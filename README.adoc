== Docs Component Configuration


This repository contains an Antora docs component.
Keep in mind these key repository features:

* Component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's _antora.yml_ file.

* The navigation for Sync Gateway is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.

* Production branches use the *release/X.Y* naming pattern (e.g., release/2.8, release/3.0).

 ** The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically aggregate any branch names that start with *release/*.


== Documentation Site Toolchain


The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.
Once merged into a version branch, the source files and their assets are aggregated, converted to HTML, and published by Antora to our staging and production sites.

The docs components and {url-ui}[site UI] are orchestrated by the {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] as described in the {url-contribute}[contributing guide].


== Significant Files


._partials Files
* `_set_page_context.adoc` +
The contents of the `modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/_set_page_context.adoc` file are used to set-up the environment for each page.
+
This file in turn calls `_define_page_index.adoc` and `_define_component_attributes.adoc`.
+
Together, these included files define a tailored, platform-specific environment, whilst utilizing common text files to describe Couchbase Lite functionality.

* `_define_component_attributes.adoc` +
The
`modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/_attributes_local.adoc`
file sets the value of attributes.

* `_define_page_index.adoc` +
This file sets the page xref attributes used in cross-references throughout the documentation.
It picks-up the platform parameters from the `_set_page_context.adoc`

* `block-related-content-<topic>.adoc` +
These files are/may be used to present the appropriate releated content links at the foot of each page.

* `blocklinks-cbl.adoc` +
Presents a standard parameterized block of links into the array of Couchbase Lite platform modules.

* `pn-issues-list.adoc` +
This file is used to hold all issues, known errors etc for this 'major' release.
Its contents are included in the release notes.

* `stats-scheme-<group>.adoc` +
Provide xref links into the stats schema.
Included by `stats-monitoring.adoc`.

* `topic-group-<topic>.adoc` +
Use to present a standardized _related links_ section at the head of 'most' pages.

* The `static_restapi` folder +
The content of this folder are generated using Swagger2Markup to process the various API yaml files and produce browseable API content. +
+
Generate the docs by using a terminal to run `mvn generate-sources` from within the `assets/s2adoc` folder.



.Assets Files
* `assets/s2adoc` folder +
The contents of this folder provide Swagger2Markup configuration to generate static pages for the API content; these supplement the SwaggerUI pages.
+
Generate the docs by using a terminal to run `mvn generate-sources` from within this folder.
+
Configuration is defined in the `pom.xml` file.

* `assets/attachments/rest-api-admin.yaml` +
The contents of this file describe the ADMIN REST API. +
They are used by both Swagger2Markup and SwaggerUI to generate static and dynamic API pages respectively.

* `assets/attachments/rest-api-public.yaml` +
The contents of this file describe the PUBLIC REST API.
They are used by both Swagger2Markup and SwaggerUI to generate static and dynamic API pages respectively.

* `assets/attachments/rest-api-metrics.yaml` +

They are used by both Swagger2Markup and SwaggerUI to generate static and dynamic API pages respectively.

* `assets/attachments/SG_<object>_model.adoc` files +
The contents of these files describe the data properties of selected API elements.
They are generated from the `rest-api-admin.yaml` file and are used to provide content in the `configuration-schema-<object>.adoc` pages.


== Page Structure


Within the ROOT/PAGES folder, each page calls

. `_set_page_context.adoc`, which in turn:

.. Sets any required module-level (ROOT) parameters

.. Invokes `_define_component_attributes.adoc` to set common attributes

.. Invokes `_define_page_index.adoc` to set up xref attribute for page cross-references

.. Invokes `_define_glossary_links.adoc` to set up xref attributes for the glossary

. Invokes `_show_page_header_block.adoc` to render the standard page header, abstract etc

. Renders the required content

. Includes a `common` footer file, for example `block-related-content-api.adoc`
