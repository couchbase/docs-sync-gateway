= Import Processing

== Overview

The *import process* is a key part of mobile convergence.
It is the means by which {sgw} becomes aware of non-{sgw} data changes and obtains the mobile metadata it requires to replicate changes.

== Operation

Any non-{sgw} change is eligible for import. For more information, refer to the xref:sync-function.adoc[Sync Function] documentation.

The document is first run through the Sync Function to compute read security and routing, with the following differences:

* The import is processed with an admin user context in the Sync Function, similar to writes made through the {sgw} Admin API.
This means that `requireAccess`, `requireUser` and `requireRole` calls in the Sync Function are treated as no-ops.
* During import, `oldDoc` is `nil` when the Sync Function is executed.

You can specify a filter function dynamically using xref:rest_api_admin_static.adoc#get_keyspace-_config-import_filter[/{keyspace}/_config/import_filter], or you can define one when you set up a database.
Refer to the xref:configuration-schema-import-filter.adoc[Import Filter Configuration] documentation for more information.

TIP: Use the `logging-console-log-keys` in the xref:configuration-schema-bootstrap.adoc#lbl-schema[Bootstrap Schema] log key to troubleshoot import processing issues in the logs.
