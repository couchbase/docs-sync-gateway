= Audit Logging Events Reference
:page-edition: Enterprise
:description: Audit Logging provides tools for administrators to track operational irregularities and to support regulatory and security compliance standards, such as link:https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html[HIPAA] and link:https://soc2.co.uk/soc2[SOC-2]. Below is a list of possible Audit Events.

== About Audit Events

You can use audit events to track and provide context on user activity within your application.

.Events table field description
[cols="2*"]
|===

| Field Name | Description

|`ID`
|A unique number used to distinguish between Audit Events.
You can use the value to specify which events will be present or written to your audit logs, either globally or on a database level.

|`Name` 
|A short descriptive name, this will be outputted as a field in the audit log.

|`Description`
|A longer name, this is will be outputted as a field in the audit log.

|`DefaultEnabled`
|If `true`, the given Audit Event is enabled by default.

|`Filterable`
|If `true`, the given audit event can be disabled.

|`EventScope`
|The scope of the event.
This can be `Global` or `Database`.
You can configure global scope events via the xref:configuration-schema-bootstrap.adoc#logging-audit-audit_log_file_path[bootstrap config], and database events via the xref:rest_api_admin.adoc[Admin REST API].

|`EventType`
|The type of action performed by the event.
This can be `user`, `admin`, or `data`.

|`MandatoryFields`
|Fields that are always present in a given Audit Event.

|`OptionalFields`
|May or may not be present in a given Audit Event.

|===

=== Audit Event Types

Audit Events can be one of the following types:

* `Admin` - Events that track administrative and configuration changes.

* `Data` - Events that track attempts to access and change data.

* `User` - Events that track end-user operations.

=== Audit Event Scopes

Audit events have scope, this affects how they can be configured.
The audit events scopes are:

* `Database` - These events are specific to a database such as `AuditIDDocumentUpdate 55002`, and can only be enabled/disabled at the database configuration level. 
Database level audit events are segregated into per Sync Gateway database specific audit logs.

*  `Global` - These events are considered global such as `AuditIDSyncGatewayStartup 53260`, and have to be enabled/disabled in the bootstrap config.
