== Introduction

Couchbase Server provides the backing data store for Sync Gateway and it is compatible -- see: {compatibility--xref}.
However, there are considerations you needs to be aware of when using some Couchbase Server features with Sync Gateway.

One of those instances concerns the use of {server-collections--xref}.


== Using Collections

Sync Gateway will support default scopes/collections.


== Constraints

Sync Gateway does not currently support Couchbase Server Named Collections.
