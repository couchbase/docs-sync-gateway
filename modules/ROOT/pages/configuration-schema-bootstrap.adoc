== Introduction

Sync Gateway's bootstrap configuration is provisioned in a JSON format file, which defines its runtime behavior - see <<lbl-schema>> for more details on the file content.

Sync Gateway will look for the following configuration file unless you direct it otherwise: +
`/home/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json`

Use the following command to run Sync Gateway with a configuration file:

[source, bashrc]
----
sync_gateway sync-gateway-bootstrap.json
----

== Bootstrap Configuration Schema

This schema identifies all the configurable properties.
Note that these properties are either:

* `static` -- changes require a {sgw} reload.
* `dynamic` -- changes require no {sgw} reload.

Currently only changes in the `logging` category are `dynamic`.
Changes to these properties are not persisted beyond a {sgw} reload.
