== Introduction

The {sgw-te} bootstrap configuration is provisioned in a JSON format file.
The configuration properties define {sgw}'s runtime behavior.
See the <<lbl-schema, schema>> below for more details on these properties.

{sgw-s} will look for the following configuration file unless you direct it otherwise: +
`/home/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json`

Use the following command to run Sync Gateway with a configuration file:

[source, bashrc]
----
sync_gateway sync-gateway-bootstrap.json
----

== Bootstrap Configuration Schema

This schema identifies all the configurable properties.
Note that these properties are either:

* `static` -- changes require a {sgw} reload.
* `dynamic` -- these changes can be applied through the REST endpoint and do not need a SGW restart.
Currently this includes only changes in the `logging` category.
Changes to these properties are not persisted beyond a {sgw} restart.
