== Introduction

Sync Gateway's bootstrap configuration is provisioned in a JSON format file, which defines its runtime behavior - see <<lbl-schema>> for more details on the file content.

Sync Gateway will look for the following configuration file unless you direct it otherwise: +
`/home/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json`



Use the following command to run Sync Gateway with a configuration file:

[source, bashrc]
----
sync_gateway sync-gateway-bootstrap.json
