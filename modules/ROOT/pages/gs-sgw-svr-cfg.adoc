Assuming you have an operational Couchbase Server deployment then:

== STEP 1 -- Create a bucket

We will use this bucket to test the deployment of Sync Gateway, later in the Getting Started section.

. Login to Couchbase Server's Admin Console
.. Go to `+http://localhost:8091+`
.. Enter your administrator credentials

. Within the Admin Console's toolbar,
.. Select the *Buckets* tab
.. btn:[Add Bucket] to continue
+
image::cb-create-bucket.png[]
.. In the pop-up window, enter *getting-started-bucket* for the *name* and click *Add Bucket*.
You can leave the other options to their defaults.

== STEP 2 -- Create RBAC user

// tag::create-rbac-user[]

In order for Sync Gateway to connect to Couchbase Server, you must create an RBAC user.
The RBAC user credentials will be used in a later section to start Sync Gateway.

. Open the *Security* tab and click the *Add User* button.

. The steps to create the RBAC user differ slightly depending on the version of Couchbase Server that you have installed. We explain the differences below.
+
[{tabs}]
====
Couchbase Server 5.5 or above::
+
In the pop-up window, provide a *Username* (`sync_gateway`) and *Password* (`password`).
+
These credentials are used by Sync Gateway to connect to Couchbase Server (see: {xref-pfx}gs-sgw-config.adoc#configure-sync-gateway[Configure Sync Gateway]).
+
You must grant these RBAC roles to the user(as shown on the image below):

* *Application Access*
* *Read Only Admin* .
+
image::user-settings-5-5.png[]

Couchbase Server 5.1::
+
In the pop-up window, provide a *Username* and *Password*, those credentials will be used by Sync Gateway to connect later on.
Next, you must grant RBAC roles to that user.
If you are using Couchbase Server 5.1, you must enable the *Bucket Full Access* and *Read Only Admin* roles.

// end::create-rbac-user[]

== STEP 3 -- Set-up Network access

When installing Couchbase Server on the cloud, ensure that network permissions (or firewall settings) allow incoming connections to Couchbase Server ports.

include::partial$sgw-svr-ports.adoc[]

If this is not done, the Couchbase Server node can experience difficulty joining a cluster.

You can refer to the {xref-pfx-svr}install:install-ports.adoc
[Couchbase Server Network Configuration] guide to see the full list of available ports and their associated services.
