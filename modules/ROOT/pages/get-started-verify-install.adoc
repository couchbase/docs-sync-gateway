In this final step of the Getting Started topic we will look to link your Sync Gateway to a Couchbase Server bucket and verify that sync is taking place by executing a CRUD cycle.
You will need to edit the configuration file used in the {get-started-install--xref} step to point to a bucket on your Couchbase Server -- see <<lbl-config>>.

On completion of this topic you will have a working Sync Gateway instance that you know syncs with a Couchbase Server.
You will have successfully completed installation and can now build on this with confidence.


[#lbl-config]
== Bootstrap Sync Gateway

To configure Sync Gateway to connect to a Couchbase Server:

. Ensure your Sync Gateway service is stopped/unloaded
. Edit the configuration file you used in {get-started-install--xref} and replace the contents with those shown in <<sample-cfg>>.
+
The configuration points to your Couchbase Server cluster, which we will use to verify that you can synchronize changes made through the Sync Gateway API with those made through Couchbase Server.
. Ensure you start Couchbase Server
. Restart/Load your Sync Gateway  to pick-up the changed configuration

[#sample-cfg]
.Simple Sync Gateway Bootstrap Config
====
[source,json]
----

{
  "bootstrap": {
    "server": "couchbases://localhost", // <.>
    "username": "sync_gateway", // <.>
    "password": "password", //
    "server_tls_skip_verify": true, // <.>
    "use_tls_server": false // <.>
  },
  "logging": { // <.>
    "console": {
      "enabled": true,
      "log_level": "info",
      "log_keys": ["*"]
    }
  }
}

----

About the Configuration Properties::
<.> Here we point to the Couchbase Server cluster using secure connection. Server ships with self signed certs that work out of the box, as long as `server_tls_skip_verify` is set, as it is below.
<.> Here we provide the credentials for the RBAC user that you created on the Couchbase Server Admin Console -- see {get-started-prepare--config-server--xref}
<.> Here we opt to ignore CA Cert verification of the certificate presented by the server; allowing for example use of self-signed certificate. The connection is unverified but encrypted.
<.> Optionally, you can choose to run without TLS, in which case you should also use `couchbase://localhost` for connection
<.> Define your logging requirements: +
Here we set general diagnostic console logs on.
If you're having issues then refer to {logging--xref} for how to tune diagnostics to provide additional troubleshooting help
====

.Start Sync Gateway

Run the following in a terminal:
----
bin/sync_gateway -<options> sgwconfig.json // <.>
----
<.> Optionally provide any CLI flags you require to use


== Add a Database Configuration

We can now use the Admin REST API to add a database to our {sgw} cluster.

The `curl` command shown in <<ex-add-sgw-db>> requires basic authentication using the `api_admin` Couchbase Server RBAC user's credentials we created in <<tbd>>.
It adds a `traveldb` database pointing to the Couchbase Server's `travel-sample` bucket.

[#ex-add-sgw-db]
.Add a Sync Gateway Database
====
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:4985/traveldb/' \  // <.>
--header 'Authorization: Basic c3luY19nYXRld2F5OnBhc3N3b3Jk' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "bucket": "travel-sample", // <.>
    "num_index_replicas": 0 // <.>
    }
----
<.> Here we specify the name of the {sgw} database -- `traveldb`
<.> Now we point `traveldb` at the Couchbase Server bucket `travel-sample`, which we created in {get-started-prepare--config-server--xref}
<.> Set to zero for this example database
// <.> Here we specify the {sgw} `users` able to access the databaseintroduces a guest user with access to all channels and all documents
====




== Add a Sync Gateway User

We can now create a {sgw} user and role to allow secure access during replication on this {sgw} cluster.

=== Add a role
The `curl` command shown in <<ex-add-role>> requires basic authentication using the `api_admin` Couchbase Server RBAC user's credentials we created in <<tbd>>.
It adds a role called `stdrole`.

[#ex-add-sgw-db]
.Add a Sync Gateway Role
====
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:4985/traveldb/_role/stdrole' \ // <.>
--header 'Authorization: Basic c3luY19nYXRld2F5OnBhc3N3b3Jk' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "stdrole",
    "admin_channels": ["newrolechannel"] // <.>
}'

----
<.> Here we identify the name of the {sgw} database -- `traveldb` +
The action, `_role` and +
The role's name `stdrole`
<.> Now we identify the channels accessible to users assigned this role; these will be used by the Sync Function to control access.

====

=== Add the user
The `curl` command shown in <<ex-add-user>> requires basic authentication using the `api_admin` Couchbase Server RBAC user's credentials we created in <<tbd>>.
It adds a user called `sgwuser1`.

[#ex-add-sgw-db]
.Add a Sync Gateway Role
====
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:4985/traveldb/_user/sgwuser1' \ // <.>
--header 'Authorization: Basic c3luY19nYXRld2F5OnBhc3N3b3Jk' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "sgwuser1", //
    "roles": ["stdrole"] // <.>
    "admin_channels": ["public"] // <.>
}'

----
<.> Here we identify +
The name of the {sgw} database -- `traveldb` +
The create user action, `_user` and +
The user's name `sgwuser1`
<.> Now we identify any roles accessible to this user; it will inherit any channels associated with the role(s).
<.> Now we identify any channels accessible to this user, in addition to those inherited from the role; these will be used by the Sync Function to control access.

====


== Connect to Sync Gateway
TIP: You can use {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console} to aid diagnosis of connection issues

. With Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server started, point your browser to the Sync Gateway url, typically on port 4984, but this can be changed -- see: {rest-api-access--xref}.
+
So, for example:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
http://localhost:4984
----

. Check that you receive a response similar to this:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"{version}"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/\{version-full}(376;e2e7d42) EE"}
----
+
If there are issues then check the {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console} for more information.
Where necessary you can redirect console output to a file -- see: {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console-redirect}.

TIP: If Sync Gateway is behind a load balancer then check the websockets configuration -- see {load-balancer--xref}.


== Verify the CRUD Cycle

Here we will use CURL and Sync Gateway's REST API to

. <<lbl-crud-crt>> Use the API to add a document and check the document on Couchbase Server
. <<lbl-crud-get>> Read the document back from Couchbase Server using the Sync Gateway API
. <<lbl-crud-upd>> Update the newly created document and observe the changes in Couchbase Server
. <<lbl-crud-upd-svr>> Update the document in Couchase Server and check the change in Sync Gateway
. <<lbl-crud-del>> Delete our document and check its state on Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway.

Remember to use the credentials of the Couchbase Server RBAC user for authentication.


[#ex-sync]

[#lbl-crud-crt]
=== Create a New Document:

Within a terminal use CURL to issue the following POST request, which adds a new document to the Couchbase Server bucket `get-started-bucket` by way of the Sync Gateway database `get-started-bucket` we configured in <<lbl-config>>

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/hotel_88801' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic c2d3dXNlcjE6cGFzc3dvcmQ=' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "_id": "hotel_88801",
    "id": "88801",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Verify-Install Topic",
    "address": "The Shambles",
    "city": "Manchester",
    "country": "United Kingdom"
}'
----

[#lbl-crud-add-resp, reftext=Response to Add Document Request]
.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"id":"hotel_88801",
"ok":true,
"rev":"1-f28b5cc13a38892f4f85913d4e654270"}
----

[#lbl-check-cbs, reftext=Check Document on Couchbase Server]
.Check
View the document in Couchbase Server Admin Console to verify it syncs from Sync Gateway database.

. Within the Admin Console, select *Buckets* and hit the btn:[Documents] button to open the _Document Editor_ tab.

. Within the _Document Editor_ tab:
+
.. Enter `travel-sample` as _Bucket_
.. Leave _Scope_ and _Collection_ as `_default`
.. Enter `id="88801"` as _M1QL WHERE_ query
.. kbd:[Enter]
+
You will see the response shown in <<img-cbs-view>>.
The document should include any changes made through Sync Gateway, including the initial create.

[#lbl-crud-get]
=== Get a Document Using the API:

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/hotel_88801' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic c3luY19nYXRld2F5OnBhc3N3b3Jk'
----

.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel_88801",
    "_rev": "1-f28b5cc13a38892f4f85913d4e654270",
    "address": "The Shambles",

    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "id": "88801",
    "name": "Verify-Install Topic",
    "type": "hotel"
}
----

[#lbl-crud-upd]
=== Update a Document using API:

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location -g --request PUT 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/hotel_88801?new_edits=true&rev=1-f28b5cc13a38892f4f85913d4e654270' \  // <.>
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "_id": "hotel_88801",
  "id": "88801",
  "type": "hotel"
  "name": "Verify-Install Topic Updated", // <.>
  "address": "The Shambles",
  "city": "Manchester",
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "email": "enquiries@hotel_88801.internet" // <.>
}'
----
<.> This revision is the one returned by the response to the initial POST request -- see: <<lbl-crud-add-resp>>
<.> Here we change the text of the _name_ field.
<.> Here we add an _email_ field.

[#lbl-crud-upd-resp, reftext=Response to Update Document Request]
.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{
    "id": "hotel_88801",
    "ok": true,
    "rev": "2-249366b198e81f203d7ae9eb54376210"  // <.>
}
----

<.> Here the `"ok":true` indicates success, whilst the revision shows it is the second change to this document.

.Check
<<lbl-check-cbs>>.
Does the document contain the changed _data_ value?

[#lbl-crud-upd-svr]
=== Sync a Couchbase Server Change

This will show that changes made using Couchbase Server are replicated to Sync Gateway.

. Within the Couchbase Server Document Editor

.. Retrieve `88801` if it is not currently displayed +
Use `meta().id="hotel_88801"` as query
.. Edit the _email_ value to contain `reception@hotel_88801.internet`
.. Edit the _name_ value to contain `Verify-Install Topic-Updated-In-Server`
.. btn:[Save] the change. +

. In your terminal, use the API to get the document again -- see <<lbl-crud-get>> +
You should see the change you made in Couchbase Server reflected in the response. For example:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"_id":"hotel_88801","_rev":"3-cc2e758ef63b0daf5b01b2baf98c72b6", // <.>
"address":"The Shambles","city":"Manchester","country":"United Kingdom","email":"reception@hotel_88801.internet","id":"88801","name":"Verify-Install Topic-Updated-In-Server","type":"hotel"}

----
<.> Note that the revision sequence is now 3, up from the 2 returned in our <<lbl-crud-upd-resp>>
<.> Note that the _email_ and _name_ fielda now contains both the change made in Sync Gateway and the amendment made in Couchbase Server ("reception")


[#lbl-crud-del]
=== Delete a Document Using API

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location -g --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/88801?rev=3-cc2e758ef63b0daf5b01b2baf98c72b6' // <.>
----
<.> Note that we provide here the revision ID of the latest revision (3), as returned in the response to the last GET request.

.Response
You should see the following response:
[{snippet-header}]
----
{
    "id": "hotel_88801",
    "ok": true,
    "rev": "4-03f1ba127340e8c50c31a36279298e60" // <.>
}
----
<.> You can see here that the delete counts as the fourth change/revision. Again "ok":true indicates the delete was successful.

.Check

* <<lbl-check-cbs>> and you should now see "No Results"

* Use the API to get the document -- see:  <<lbl-crud-get>>.
Assuming the delete worked you should see the following response:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"error":"not_found","reason":"deleted"}%
----


== Ways to Verify Sync
To verify that document changes have been replicated, you can:

* Monitor the Sync Gateway revision number returned by the database endpoint (xref:{rest-api--page}#/database/get\__db__[GET /\{tkn-db}/]).
The revision number increments for every change that happens on the Sync Gateway database.
* Query a document by ID on the Sync Gateway REST API as shown in <<lbl-check-cbs>>. Use (xref:{rest-api--page}#/document/get\__db___doc_[GET /\{tkn-db}/\{id}]) -- see: {rest-api-access--xref} for more.
* Query a document from the Query Workbench on the Couchbase Server Console.


== Next Steps

Now you know Sync Gateway is deployed and operational.
So, you can explore more complex scenarios with confidence.

Maybe you want to learn more about Sync Gateway's {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref} or how to {sync-with-couchbase-server--xref}. Or perhaps you want to explore how to:

* Implement access controls for users and data -- see: {users--xref}, {roles--xref} and the {sync-function--xref} that ties it all together.

* Implement secure connectivity using TLS/SSL, which is described in {authentication-users--xref} and {authentication-certs--xref}

* Build more complex syncs, such as those that sync with:
** Other Sync Gateway nodes, for which see {sync-inter-syncgateway-overview--xref}
** Apps on mobile devices using Couchbase Lite -- see {sync-using-app--xref}
