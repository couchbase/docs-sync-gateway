== Introduction


In this final step of the Getting Started topic we will look to link your {sgw-te} to a {cbs-te} bucket and verify that sync is taking place by executing a CRUD cycle.
You will need to edit the configuration file used in the {get-started-install--xref} step to point to a bucket on your {cbs} -- see <<lbl-config>>.

On completion of this topic you will have a working {sgw} instance that you know syncs with a {cbs}.
You will have successfully completed installation and can now build on this with confidence.


[#lbl-config]
== Bootstrap Sync Gateway

To configure {sgw} to connect to a {cbs}:

. Ensure your {sgw} service is stopped/unloaded
. Edit the configuration file you used in {get-started-install--xref} and replace the contents with those shown in <<sample-cfg>>.
+
The configuration points to your {cbs} cluster, which we will use to verify that you can synchronize changes made through the {sgw} API with those made through {cbs}.
. Ensure you start {cbs}
. Restart/Load your {sgw}  to pick-up the changed configuration


[#sample-cfg]
.Simple Sync Gateway Bootstrap Config
====

[source, json]
----

{
  "bootstrap": {
    "server": "couchbases://localhost", // <.>
    "username": "sync_gateway", // <.>
    "password": "password", //
    "server_tls_skip_verify": true, // <.>
    "use_tls_server": true // <.>
  },
  "logging": { // <.>
    "console": {
      "enabled": true,
      "log_level": "info",
      "log_keys": ["*"]
    }
  }
}

----


About the Configuration Properties::

<.> Here we point to the {cbs} cluster using secure connection. Server ships with self signed certs that work out of the box, as long as `server_tls_skip_verify` is set, as it is below.

<.> Here we provide the credentials for the RBAC user that you created on the {cbs} Admin Console -- see {get-started-prepare--config-server--xref}

<.> Here we opt to ignore CA Cert verification of the certificate presented by the server; allowing for example use of self-signed certificate. The connection is unverified but encrypted.

<.> Optionally, you can choose to run without TLS, by setting this value `false`.
In that case you should also use the plaintext URI `couchbase://localhost` to connect.

<.> Define your logging requirements: +
Here we set general diagnostic console logs on.
If you're having issues then refer to {logging--xref} for how to tune diagnostics to provide additional troubleshooting help

====

.Start Sync Gateway

Run the following in a terminal:
[source, bash]
----
bin/sync_gateway -<options> sgwconfig.json // <.>
----
<.> Optionally provide any CLI flags you require to use


== Add a Database Configuration


We can now use the Admin REST API to add a database to our {sgw} cluster.

The `curl` command shown in <<ex-add-sgw-db>> requires basic authentication using the `api_admin` {cbs} RBAC user's credentials we created in Step 2 of {get-started-prepare--xref--create-rbac-users}.
It adds a `traveldb` database pointing to the {cbs}'s `travel-sample` bucket.

[#ex-add-sgw-db]
.Add a Sync Gateway Database
====

----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:4985/traveldb/' \  // <.>
--header 'Authorization: Basic c3luY19nYXRld2F5OnBhc3N3b3Jk' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "bucket": "travel-sample", // <.>
    "num_index_replicas": 0 // <.>
    }
----
<.> Here we specify the name of the {sgw} database -- `traveldb`
<.> Now we point `traveldb` at the {cbs} bucket `travel-sample`, which we created in {get-started-prepare--config-server--xref}
<.> Set to zero for this example database
// <.> Here we specify the {sgw} `users` able to access the databaseintroduces a guest user with access to all channels and all documents
====


== Add a Sync Gateway User


We can now create a {sgw} user and role to allow secure access during replication on this {sgw} cluster.

=== Add a role

The `curl` command shown in <<ex-add-role>> requires basic authentication using the `api_admin` {cbs} RBAC user's credentials we created in Step 2 of {get-started-prepare--xref--create-rbac-users}.
It adds a role called `stdrole`.

[#ex-add-role]
.Add a Sync Gateway Role
====
[source, bash]
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:4985/traveldb/_role/stdrole' \ // <.>
--header 'Authorization: Basic c3luY19nYXRld2F5OnBhc3N3b3Jk' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "stdrole",
    "admin_channels": ["newrolechannel"] // <.>
}'

----

<.> Here we identify the name of the {sgw} database -- `traveldb` +
The action, `_role` and +
The role's name `stdrole`

<.> Now we identify the channels accessible to users assigned this role; these will be used by the Sync Function to control access.

====

=== Add the user

The `curl` command shown in <<ex-add-user>> requires basic authentication using the `api_admin` {cbs} RBAC user's credentials we created in Step 2 of {get-started-prepare--xref--create-rbac-users}.
It adds a user called `sgwuser1`.

[#ex-add-user]
.Add a Sync Gateway User
====
[source, bash]
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:4985/traveldb/_user/sgwuser1' \ // <.>

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "sgwuser1", //
    "roles": ["stdrole"] // <.>
    "admin_channels": ["public"] // <.>
}'

----
<.> Here we identify +
The name of the {sgw} database -- `traveldb` +
The create user action, `_user` and +
The user's name `sgwuser1`
<.> Now we identify any roles accessible to this user; it will inherit any channels associated with the role(s).
<.> Now we identify any channels accessible to this user, in addition to those inherited from the role; these will be used by the Sync Function to control access.

== Connect to Sync Gateway


TIP: You can use {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console} to aid diagnosis of connection issues

. With {sgw} and {cbs} started, point your browser to the {sgw} url, typically on port 4984, but this can be changed -- see: {rest-api-access--xref}.
+
So, for example:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
http://localhost:4984
----

. Check that you receive a response similar to this:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"{version}"},"version":"Couchbase {sgw}/\{version-full}(376;e2e7d42) EE"}
----
+
If there are issues then check the {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console} for more information.
Where necessary you can redirect console output to a file -- see: {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console-redirect}.

TIP: If {sgw} is behind a load balancer then check the websockets configuration -- see {load-balancer--xref}.


== Verify the CRUD Cycle

Here we will use CURL and {sgw}'s REST API to

. <<lbl-crud-crt>> Use the API to add a document and check the document on {cbs}

. <<lbl-crud-get>> Read the document back from {cbs} using the {sgw} API

. <<lbl-crud-upd>> Update the newly created document and observe the changes in {cbs}

. <<lbl-crud-upd-svr>> Update the document in Couchase Server and check the change in {sgw}

. <<lbl-crud-del>> Delete our document and check its state on {cbs} and {sgw}.

Remember to use the credentials of the {cbs} RBAC user for authentication.


[#ex-sync]

[#lbl-crud-crt]
=== Create a New Document:

Within a terminal use CURL to issue the following POST request, which adds a new document to the {cbs} bucket `get-started-bucket` by way of the {sgw} database `get-started-bucket` we configured in <<lbl-config>>

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/hotel_88801' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic c2d3dXNlcjE6cGFzc3dvcmQ=' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "_id": "hotel_88801",
    "id": "88801",
    "type": "hotel",
    "name": "Verify-Install Topic",
    "address": "The Shambles",
    "city": "Manchester",
    "country": "United Kingdom"
}'
----

[#lbl-crud-add-resp, reftext=Response to Add Document Request]
.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"id":"hotel_88801",
"ok":true,
"rev":"1-f28b5cc13a38892f4f85913d4e654270"}
----

[#lbl-check-cbs, reftext=Check Document on Couchbase Server]
.Check
View the document in {cbs} Admin Console to verify it syncs from {sgw} database.

. Within the Admin Console, select *Buckets* and hit the btn:[Documents] button to open the _Document Editor_ tab.

. Within the _Document Editor_ tab:
+
.. Enter `travel-sample` as _Bucket_
.. Leave _Scope_ and _Collection_ as `_default`
.. Enter `id="88801"` as _M1QL WHERE_ query
.. kbd:[Enter]
+
You will see the response shown in <<img-cbs-view>>.
The document should include any changes made through {sgw}, including the initial create.

[#lbl-crud-get]
=== Get a Document Using the API:

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/hotel_88801' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic c3luY19nYXRld2F5OnBhc3N3b3Jk'
----

.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel_88801",
    "_rev": "1-f28b5cc13a38892f4f85913d4e654270",
    "address": "The Shambles",

    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "id": "88801",
    "name": "Verify-Install Topic",
    "type": "hotel"
}
----

[#lbl-crud-upd]
=== Update a Document using API:

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location -g --request PUT 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/hotel_88801?new_edits=true&rev=1-f28b5cc13a38892f4f85913d4e654270' \  // <.>
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "_id": "hotel_88801",
  "id": "88801",
  "type": "hotel"
  "name": "Verify-Install Topic Updated", // <.>
  "address": "The Shambles",
  "city": "Manchester",
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "email": "enquiries@hotel_88801.internet" // <.>
}'
----
<.> This revision is the one returned by the response to the initial POST request -- see: <<lbl-crud-add-resp>>
<.> Here we change the text of the _name_ field.
<.> Here we add an _email_ field.

[#lbl-crud-upd-resp, reftext=Response to Update Document Request]
.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{
    "id": "hotel_88801",
    "ok": true,
    "rev": "2-249366b198e81f203d7ae9eb54376210"  // <.>
}
----

<.> Here the `"ok":true` indicates success, whilst the revision shows it is the second change to this document.

.Check
<<lbl-check-cbs>>.
Does the document contain the changed _data_ value?

[#lbl-crud-upd-svr]
=== Sync a Couchbase Server Change

This will show that changes made using {cbs} are replicated to {sgw}.

. Within the {cbs} Document Editor

.. Retrieve `88801` if it is not currently displayed +
Use `meta().id="hotel_88801"` as query
.. Edit the _email_ value to contain `reception@hotel_88801.internet`
.. Edit the _name_ value to contain `Verify-Install Topic-Updated-In-Server`
.. btn:[Save] the change. +

. In your terminal, use the API to get the document again -- see <<lbl-crud-get>> +
You should see the change you made in {cbs} reflected in the response. For example:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"_id":"hotel_88801","_rev":"3-cc2e758ef63b0daf5b01b2baf98c72b6", // <.>
"address":"The Shambles","city":"Manchester","country":"United Kingdom","email":"reception@hotel_88801.internet","id":"88801","name":"Verify-Install Topic-Updated-In-Server","type":"hotel"}

----
<.> Note that the revision sequence is now 3, up from the 2 returned in our <<lbl-crud-upd-resp>>
<.> Note that the _email_ and _name_ fielda now contains both the change made in {sgw} and the amendment made in {cbs} ("reception")


[#lbl-crud-del]
=== Delete a Document Using API

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location -g --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4985/traveldb/88801?rev=3-cc2e758ef63b0daf5b01b2baf98c72b6' // <.>
----
<.> Note that we provide here the revision ID of the latest revision (3), as returned in the response to the last GET request.

.Response
You should see the following response:
[{snippet-header}]
----
{
    "id": "hotel_88801",
    "ok": true,
    "rev": "4-03f1ba127340e8c50c31a36279298e60" // <.>
}
----
<.> You can see here that the delete counts as the fourth change/revision. Again "ok":true indicates the delete was successful.

.Check

* <<lbl-check-cbs>> and you should now see "No Results"

* Use the API to get the document -- see:  <<lbl-crud-get>>.
Assuming the delete worked you should see the following response:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"error":"not_found","reason":"deleted"}%
----


== Ways to Verify Sync


To verify that document changes have been replicated, you can:

* Monitor the {sgw} revision number returned by the database endpoint (xref:{rest-api--page}#/database/get\__db__[GET /\{tkn-db}/]).
The revision number increments for every change that happens on the {sgw} database.
* Query a document by ID on the {sgw} REST API as shown in <<lbl-check-cbs>>. Use (xref:{rest-api--page}#/document/get\__db___doc_[GET /\{tkn-db}/\{id}]) -- see: {rest-api-access--xref} for more.
* Query a document from the Query Workbench on the {cbs} Console.


.Next Steps
****
Now you know {sgw} is deployed and operational.
So, you can explore more complex scenarios with confidence.

Maybe you want to learn more about {sgw}'s {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref} or how to {sync-with-couchbase-server--xref}. Or perhaps you want to explore how to:

* Implement access controls for users and data -- see: {users--xref}, {roles--xref} and the {sync-function--xref} that ties it all together.

* Implement secure connectivity using TLS/SSL, which is described in {authentication-users--xref} and {authentication-certs--xref}

* Build more complex syncs, such as those that sync with:
** Other {sgw} nodes, for which see {sync-inter-syncgateway-overview--xref}
** Apps on mobile devices using Couchbase Lite -- see {sync-using-app--xref}
