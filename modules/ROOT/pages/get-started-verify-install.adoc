.Preparatory Steps
NOTE: Before following the steps in this topic you must have read, and acted-upon, the information and steps in {get-started-prepare--xref} and {get-started-install--xref}.


== Introduction
:param-page: {page-relative-src-path}
include::partial$_get-started-topic-group.adoc[]

In this final step of the Getting Started topic we will look to link your Sync Gateway to a Couchbase Server bucket and verify that sync is taking place by executing a CRUD cycle.
You will need to edit the configuration file used in the {get-started-install--xref} step to point to a bucket on your Couchbase Server -- see <<lbl-config>>.

On completion of this topic you will have a working Sync Gateway instance that you know syncs with a Couchbase Server.
You will have successfully completed installation and can now build on this with confidence.


[#lbl-config]
== Configure Sync Gateway

To configure Sync Gateway to connect to a Couchbase Server:

. Ensure your Sync Gateway service is stopped/unloaded
. Edit the configuration file you used in {get-started-install--xref} and replace the contents with those shown in <<sample-cfg>>.
+
The configuration points to the `get-started-bucket` which we will use to verify that you can synchronize changes made through the Sync Gateway API with those made through Couchbase Server.
. Ensure you start Couchbase Server
. Restart/Load your Sync Gateway  to pick-up the changed configuration

About the Configuration Properties::
<.> Here we point to the Couchbase Server bucket you created in {get-started-prepare--config-server--xref}
<.> Provided the credentials for the RBAC user that you created on the Couchbase Server Admin Console -- see {get-started-prepare--config-server--xref}
<.> Set `enable_shared_bucket_access` true to allow both Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server to make changes to the same bucket. This works in conjunction with `import_docs` to facilitate the replication of changes whether made through Sync Gateway or externally by an App or Couchbase Server SDK for example.
<.> Set `import_docs` true to allow import processing to take place on this Sync Gateway node, thereby integrating document changes made outside of Sync Gateway
<.> `num_index_replicas` is the number of index replicas stored in Couchbase Server -- see {xref-sgw-pg-indexing}. +
*NOTE:* If you're running a single Couchbase Server node for development purposes the `num_index_replicas` must be set to `0`.
<.> Here `users` introduces a guest user with access to all channels and all documents
<.> Define your logging requirements: +
Here we set general diagnostic console logs on.
If you're having issues then refer to {logging--xref} for how to tune diagnostics to provide additional troubleshooting help
====


== Connect to Sync Gateway
TIP: You can use {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console} to aid diagnosis of connection issues

. With Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server started, point your browser to the Sync Gateway url, typically on port 4984, but this can be changed -- see: {rest-api-access--xref}.
+
So, for example:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
http://localhost:4984
----

. Check that you receive a response similar to this:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"{version}"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/\{version-full}(376;e2e7d42) EE"}
----
+
If there are issues then check the {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console} for more information.
Where necessary you can redirect console output to a file -- see: {xref-sgw-bmk-logging-console-redirect}.

TIP: If Sync Gateway is behind a load balancer then check the websockets configuration -- see {load-balancer--xref}.


== Verify the CRUD Cycle

Here we will use CURL and Sync Gateway's REST API to

. <<lbl-crud-crt>> Use the API to add a document and check the document on Couchbase Server
. <<lbl-crud-get>> Read the document back from Couchbase Server using the Sync Gateway API
. <<lbl-crud-upd>> Update the newly created document and observe the changes in Couchbase Server
. <<lbl-crud-upd-svr>> Update the document in Couchase Server and check the change in Sync Gateway
. <<lbl-crud-del>> Delete our document and check its state on Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway.


[#ex-sync]

[#lbl-crud-crt]
=== Create a New Document:

Within a terminal use CURL to issue the following POST request, which adds a new document to the Couchbase Server bucket `get-started-bucket` by way of the Sync Gateway database `get-started-bucket` we configured in <<lbl-config>>

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location -g --request POST 'http://localhost:4984/get-started-bucket/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "_id": "first-doc",
  "name": "Verify-Install Topic",
  "type": "get-started",
  "data": "any random string"
}'
----

[#lbl-crud-add-resp, reftext=Response to Add Document Request]
.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"id":"first-doc","ok":true,"rev":"1-a46e9c2f8ff4581e5662c47ae8519b0e"}%
----

[#lbl-check-cbs, reftext=Check Document on Couchbase Server]
.Check
View the document in Couchbase Server Admin Console to verify it syncs from Sync Gateway database.

. Within the Admin Console, select *Buckets* and hit the btn:[Documents] button to open the _Document Editor_ tab.

. Within the _Document Editor_ tab:
+
.. Enter `get-started-bucket` as _Bucket_
.. Enter `first` as _Document ID_
.. kbd:[Enter]
+
You will see the response shown in <<img-cbs-view>>.
The document should include any changes made through Sync Gateway, including the initial create.
+

[#lbl-crud-get]
=== Get a Document Using the API:

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4984/get-started-bucket/first-doc'
----

.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"_id":"first-doc","_rev":"1-a46e9c2f8ff4581e5662c47ae8519b0e","data":"any random string","name":"Verify-Install Topic","type":"get-started"}%
----

[#lbl-crud-upd]
=== Update a Document using API:

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location -g --request PUT 'http://localhost:4984/get-started-bucket/first-doc' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "_id": "first-doc",
  "_rev": "1-a46e9c2f8ff4581e5662c47ae8519b0e", // <.>
  "name": "Verify-Install Topic",
  "type": "get-started",
  "data": "an edited string" // <.>
}'
----
<.> This revision is the one returned by the response to the initial POST request -- see: <<lbl-crud-add-resp>>
<.> Here we change the text of the _data_ field.

[#lbl-crud-upd-resp, reftext=Response to Update Document Request]
.Response
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"id":"first-doc","ok":true,"rev":"2-ecbdda61df3290beff4d0e433af8d745"}%  // <.>
----

<.> Here the `"ok":true` indicates success, whilst the revision shows it is the second change to this document.

.Check
<<lbl-check-cbs>>.
Does the document contain the changed _data_ value?

[#lbl-crud-upd-svr]
=== Sync a Couchbase Server Change

This will show that changes made using Couchbase Server are replicated to Sync Gateway.

. Within the Couchbase Server Document Editor

.. Retrieve `first_doc` if it is not currently displayed
.. Edit the _data_ value to contain `"an edited string also changed in server"`
.. btn:[Save] the change. +

. In your terminal, use the API to get the document again -- see <<lbl-crud-get>> +
You should see the change you made in Couchbase Server reflected in the response. For example:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"_id":"first-doc","_rev":"3-cc2e758ef63b0daf5b01b2baf98c72b6", // <.>
"data":"an edited string also changed in server", // <.>
"name":"Verify-Install Topic","type":"get-started"}
----
<.> Note that the revision sequence is now 3, up from the 2 returned in our <<lbl-crud-upd-resp>>
<.> Note that the data field now contains both the change made in Sync Gateway ("an edited string") and that made in Couchbase Server ("also changed in server")


[#lbl-crud-del]
=== Delete a Document Using API

.Request
[{snippet-header}]
----
curl --location -g --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4984/get-started-bucket/first-doc?rev=3-cc2e758ef63b0daf5b01b2baf98c72b6' // <.>
----
<.> Note that we provide here the revision ID of the latest revision (3), as returned in the response to the last GET request.

.Response
You should see the following response:
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"id":"first-doc","ok":true,"rev":"4-03f1ba127340e8c50c31a36279298e60"}%  // <.>
----
<.> You can see here that the delete counts as the fourth change/revision. Again "ok":true indicates the delete was successful.

.Check

* <<lbl-check-cbs>> and you should now see "No Results"

* Use the API to get the document -- see:  <<lbl-crud-get>>.
Assuming the delete worked you should see the following response:
+
[{snippet-header}]
----
{"error":"not_found","reason":"deleted"}%
----


== Ways to Verify Sync
To verify that document changes have been replicated, you can:

* Monitor the Sync Gateway revision number returned by the database endpoint (xref:{rest-api--page}#/database/get\__db__[GET /\{tkn-db}/]).
The revision number increments for every change that happens on the Sync Gateway database.
* Query a document by ID on the Sync Gateway REST API as shown in <<lbl-check-cbs>>. Use (xref:{rest-api--page}#/document/get\__db___doc_[GET /\{tkn-db}/\{id}]) -- see: {rest-api-access--xref} for more.
* Query a document from the Query Workbench on the Couchbase Server Console.


== Next Steps

Now you know Sync Gateway is deployed and operational.
So, you can explore more complex scenarios with confidence.

Maybe you want to learn more about Sync Gateway's {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref} or how to {sync-with-couchbase-server--xref}. Or perhaps you want to explore how to:

* Implement access controls for users and data -- see: {users--xref}, {roles--xref} and the {sync-function--xref} that ties it all together.

* Implement secure connectivity using TLS/SSL, which is described in {authentication-users--xref} and {authentication-certs--xref}

* Build more complex syncs, such as those that sync with:
** Other Sync Gateway nodes, for which see {sync-inter-syncgateway-overview--xref}
** Apps on mobile devices using Couchbase Lite -- see {sync-using-app--xref}
