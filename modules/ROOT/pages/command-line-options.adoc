= Command Line Options

To configure Sync Gateway, you can specify command-line options when you start Sync Gateway.
Command-line options can only specify a limited set of configuration properties, and cannot be used to configure multiple databases.
For more comprehensive configuration, use a JSON configuration file.
For information about using a configuration file, see the configuration file guide.

Configuration determines the runtime behavior of Sync Gateway, including server configuration and the database or set of databases with which a Sync Gateway instance can interact.

NOTE: You can only specify a small subset of configuration properties as command-line options.
Two command-line options do not have corresponding configuration properties: `-help` and `-verbose`.

When specifying command-line options, the format of the `sync_gateway` command is:

[source,bash]
----
sync_gateway [command-line options]
----

== Command-line options

You can prefix command-line options with one hyphen (-) or with two hyphens (--). For command-line options that take an argument, you specify the argument after an equal sign (=), for example, `-bucket=db`, or as a following item on the command line, for example, `-bucket db`.
Command-line options are case-insensitive.
Here we use lower camel case.

Following are the command-line options that you can specify when starting Sync Gateway.

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Option |Default |Description

|`â€‘adminInterface`
|`127.0.0.1:4985`
|Port or TCP network address (IP address and the port) that the Admin REST API listens on.

|`-bucket`
|`sync_gateway`
|Name of the Couchbase Server bucket.

|`-dbname`
|`sync_gateway`
|Name of the Couchbase Server database to serve through the Public REST API.

|`-defaultLogFilePath`
|none
|Path to log files, as a fallback default value when `logFilePath` is not specified.
This option is generally used in service scripts.

|`-help`
|none
|Lists the available options and exits.

|`-interface`
|`:4984`
|Port or TCP network address (IP address and the port) that the Public REST API listens on.

|`-log`
|`HTTP`
|Comma-separated list of log keywords to enable.
The log keyword `HTTP` is enabled by default, which means that HTTP requests and error responses are always logged.
Omitting `HTTP` from your list does not disable HTTP logging. HTTP logging can be disabled through the Admin API.

|`-logFilePath`
|none
|Path to log files.

|`-pool`
|`default`
|Name of the Couchbase Server pool in which to find buckets.

|`-pretty`
|`false`
|Pretty-print JSON responses to improve readability.
This is useful for debugging, but reduces performance.

|`-url`
|`walrus:`
|URL of the database server.
An HTTP URL implies Couchbase Server.
A `walrus:` URL implies the built-in Walrus database.
A combination of a Walrus URL and a file-style URI (for example, `walrus:///tmp/walrus`) implies the built-in Walrus database and persisting the database to a file.

|`-verbose`
|Non-verbose logging
|Logs more information about requests.

[[_examples]]
=== Examples

The following command does not include any parameters and just uses the default values.
It connects to the bucket named `sync_gateway` in the pool named `default` of the built-in Walrus database.
It is served from port 4984, with the Admin interface on port 4985.

[source,bash]
----
$ sync_gateway
----

The following command creates an ephemeral, in-memory Walrus database, served as `db`, and specifies use of pretty-printed JSON responses.
Because Walrus is the default database, the option `-url` could be omitted.

[source,bash]
----
$ sync_gateway -url=walrus: -bucket=db -pretty
----

The following command starts Sync Gateway and specifies the address of a Couchbase Server instance (instead of using the default database server, which is Walrus):

[source,bash]
----
$ ./sync_gateway -url http://cbserver:8091
----

The following command accomplishes the same things as the prior command, persists the Walrus database to a file named `/tmp/walrus/db.walrus`, and turns on additional logging for the log keys `HTTP+` and `CRUD`.

[source,bash]
----
$ sync_gateway -url=walrus:///tmp/walrus -bucket=db -log=HTTP+,CRUD
----
