include::partial$block-abstract.adoc[]

== Overview

You can configure some Sync Gateway features by specifying command-line options when you start it.


For more comprehensive configuration, use a JSON configuration file - see: {configuration-properties--xref}.

== Configuration

Configuration determines the runtime behavior of Sync Gateway, including server configuration and the database or set of databases with which a Sync Gateway instance can interact.

NOTE: Command-line options can only specify a sub-set of the available configuration properties, and cannot be used to configure multiple databases.

Two command-line options do not have corresponding configuration properties: `-help` and `-verbose`.

== Option Format

When specifying command-line options use the format shown in <<option-fmt>>

* Command-line options are case-insensitive.
* You can prefix command-line options with one hyphen (-) or with two hyphens (--).
* For command-line options that take an argument, you specify the argument after an equal sign (=). +
For example, `-bucket=db`, or as a following item on the command line, for example, `-bucket db`.
