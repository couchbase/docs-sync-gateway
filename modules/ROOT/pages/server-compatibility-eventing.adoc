== Introduction

Couchbase Server provides the backing data store for Sync Gateway and it is compatible -- see: {compatibility--xref}.
However, there are considerations you needs to be aware of when using some Couchbase Server features with Sync Gateway.

One of those instances concerns the use of {server-eventing--xref}.
This service provides a framework to operate on changes to data in real time.
In this context, events are changes to data in the Couchbase Mobile cluster.


== Using Eventing

You can use Eventing and Sync Gateway connected to the same bucket, when Eventing operates in *read only* mode.

To do this, you must write your Eventing function to be *idempotent*; to behave correctly when the same mutation is seen more than once.
This is necessary because:

* When a single document update is made directly by Sync Gateway, such as those replicated from Couchbase Lite, it generates a single server mutation that writes both the document body and the metadata.
+
But when an update originates outside of Couchbase mobile then multiple mutations are generated.
That is because Sync Gateway must update both the document's body and its _sync metadata (XATTRs).

* _Eventing_ detects these mutations and invokes its `OnUpdate` *for each*; whether it is for the modified body of the document, XATTRs, or both.
It is here that you need to code the function to apply the same update once only.
One way to do this is to use the crc64 function call -- see: {server-eventing-constructs-crc64--xref} for more on how to do this.

_Eventing_ prevents inadvertent use of its functions on _Sync Gateway_ read-write buckets.
You will see the following  warning if you try to do this: +
`SyncGateway is enabled on: <bucket-name>, deployment of source bucket mutating handler will cause Intra Bucket Recursion`
