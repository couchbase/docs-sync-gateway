Assuming you have an operational Couchbase Server deployment then:

== STEP 1 -- Create a Bucket

We will use this bucket to test the deployment of Sync Gateway, later in the Getting Started section.

. Login to Couchbase Server's Admin Console
.. Go to `+http://localhost:8091+`
.. Enter your administrator credentials

. Within the Admin Console's toolbar,
.. Select the *Buckets* tab
.. btn:[Add Bucket] to continue
+
image::cb-create-bucket.png[]
.. In the pop-up window, enter *getting-started-bucket* for the *name* and click *Add Bucket*.
You can leave the other options to their defaults.

== STEP 2 -- Create RBAC User

// tag::create-rbac-user[]

To connect to Couchbase Server, you must create an RBAC user.
These user credentials are used in a later section to start Sync Gateway.

. Open the *Security* tab and click the *Add User* button.

. Create the RBAC user with appropriate access roles.
+
The steps to do this are shown in <<rbac-roles>>. Note that they differ, depending on your Couchbase Server version.

== STEP 3 -- Set-up Network Access

When installing Couchbase Server on the cloud, ensure that network permissions (or firewall settings) allow incoming connections to Couchbase Server ports.

include::partial$sgw-svr-ports.adoc[]

If this is not done, the Couchbase Server node can experience difficulty joining a cluster.

You can refer to the {xref--pfx-svr}install:install-ports.adoc[Couchbase Server Ports] guide to see the full list of available ports and their associated services.
