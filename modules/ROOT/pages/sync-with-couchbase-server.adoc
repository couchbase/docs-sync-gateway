== Introduction


{sgw-te} will automatically sync database changes if {configuration-schema-database--xref--import-docs} and {configuration-schema-database--xref--enable-shared-bucket-access} are set 'true'.

* Enable_Shared_Bucket_Access
+
This setting ensures that both {sgw} and {cbs-te} can read and write to the same bucket simultaneously and that {sgw} can access {cbs} document XATTRS +
See: <<sgw-paths>> and {configuration-schema-database--xref--enable-shared-bucket-access}.

* Import Docs
+
Setting this property true ensures that the {sgw} node performs import processing, obtaining the mobile metadata it requires to replicate changes -- see: <<import-process>>.

You can configure both these properties using the Admin Rest API {configuration-schema-database--xref} endpoint.

[#sba-feature]
== Shared Bucket Access


Mobile applications require additional metadata in order to manage security and replication.

{sgw} stores this information using {cbs} XATTRs (see {cbs} documentation on {server-data-xattr-fundamentals--xref}).


=== Extended Attributes (XATTRs)

A document can be associated with zero or more extended attributes.

There are currently three types of XATTRS: User, System and Virtual.

Extended attributes:

* Are JSON objects that can be associated with Couchbase documents.

* Are stored and replicated along with the associated document in both intra-cluster and XDCR replication.

* Can be accessed via {cbs} SDKs using the sub-document API, via command-line tools, and via views.

* Are accessible from N1QL in {cbs} using the `().xattrs`` property. +
For example, `SELECT meta().xattrs._sync from travel-sample where Meta().id = "user::demo"`;.


Both {sgw} and {cbs} use a System extended attribute, with the following characteristics to support mobile convergence (shared bucket access):

* Shares lifetime with the document metadata - when a document is deleted, system xattrs are preserved with the tombstone.
* Allocated 1MB of storage, independent of the 20MB available for the document

WARNING: The sync metadata is maintained internally by {sgw} and its structure can change at any time.
It should not be used to drive business logic of applications.
The direct use of the N1QL query is unsupported and must not be used in production environments.
The `_raw` endpoint (/db/_raw/{docid}) on {sgw}'s Admin REST API returns both the document and its associated mobile metadata.

=== Documents

With bucket-sharing enabled, {cbs} documents can be inserted directly (using _N1QL_ or _SDKs_) or by using {sgw}'s {rest-api--xref}.

{sgw} {fn-sgw1x5} creates the metadata it needs by abstracting it from the SDK or N1QL applications reading and writing data directly to {cbs} buckets.
It uses {cbs} XATTRs {fn-cbs5x0} to store that metadata into an external document fragment -- see {xref-svr-pg-xattrs}.

// The REST API will also include the following behavioral changes:

// * Purging -- {rest-api-admin--pfx-document-post-purge} removes the document and its associated extended attributes
// * Updating -- {rest-api-admin--pfx-document-put-docid} will tombstone the active revision

=== Blobs and Attachments

.Couchbase Server SDK/N1QL
Use {sgw}'s REST API's {xref-sgw-ep-public-api-attachment} endpoints to
manage attachments and blob data; you cannot use {cbs} SDKs to do this
directly.

Standard practice would be to create the document using the SDK and then associate its blobs/attachments using the {xref-sgw-ep-public-api-attachment-put} endpoint.
You can see a practical example in this blog post --
https://blog.couchbase.com/store-sync-binary-data-attachments-blobs-couchbase-mobile

.Couchbase Lite Apps
Couchbase Lite apps seamlessly handle blobs and attachments, see the appropriate platform examples here:

:param-page: blob
include::partial$blocklinks-cbl.adoc[]

.Using a WebApp
Attachments can be accessed through {sgw}'s REST API using the xref:rest-api.adoc#/attachment/GetAttachment_[+/{tkn-db}/{doc}/{attachment}+] endpoint.

=== Tombstone Revisions

Note that, with bucket-sharing enabled, {glos-term-tombstone-revision}s are *not* retained indefinitely; they are purged based on the server's _metadata purge interval_.

To ensure tombstones are synced with clients, you should set the server's metadata purge interval based on your expected replication frequency -- see the {enable-sba-config-item} reference.

=== Accessing Sync Metadata

As stated, mobile metadata is not kept in the document, but in a system extended attribute (XATTR) in {cbs}.

The N1QL query language {fnref-cbs5x0} supports the ability to query these extended attributes (XATTRS) and hence the document's sync metadata -- see: <<simple-query>>.

[#simple-query]
.Querying XATTRS-bsed sync metadata
====
[source,sql]
----
SELECT meta().xattrs._sync FROM scope.collection WHERE meta().id = "mydocId"

====

WARNING: The sync metadata is maintained internally by {sgw} and its structure can change at any time.
It should not be used to drive business logic of applications. The direct use of the N1QL query is *unsupported* and must not be used in production environments.

=== Enable Shared Bucket Access

Shared bucket access is an opt-in feature.
You can enable it without bringing down the entire {sgw} cluster  -- see <<enable-sba>>.

[#enable-sba]

            "bucket": "my-bucket",
            "import_docs": true // <.>
        }
    }
}
----
<.> The `import_docs` property is used to specify that a {sgw} node participates (exclusively) in {import-process--xref}. The mechanism by which {sgw} incorporates changes to data buckets it shares with {cbs} -- see: <<import-process>>.

[#import-process]
== Import Processing


The *import process* is a key part of mobile convergence.
It is the means by which {sgw} becomes aware of non-{sgw} data changes and obtains the mobile metadata it requires to replicate changes.

image::shared-bucket-access.png[]

Any non-{sgw} change is eligible for import.
The document is first run through the Sync Function to compute read security and routing, with the following differences:

* The import is processed with an admin user context in the Sync Function, similar to writes made through the {sgw} Admin API.
This means that `requireAccess`, `requireUser` and `requireRole` calls in the Sync Function are treated as no-ops.
* During import, `oldDoc` is `nil` when the Sync Function is executed.

You can specify a filter function using the {configuration-schema-database--pfx--db}_import_filter[import_filter] property, which will only import specific documents.

TIP: Use the {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging-console-log-keys} log key to troubleshoot import processing issues in the logs.

=== Configuration

Note that `import_docs` only takes effect if the `enabled_shared_bucket_access` is set to `true`.

{enterprise}::
The `import_docs` parameter defaults to `true`, implying that, by default, all nodes in a cluster participate in import processing.
To exclude a node, set `"import_docs": false`.
{community}::
The `import_docs` parameter defaults to false and must be explicitly set to `true`.

The following table describes the key behavior differences between Community Edition and Enterprise Edition when `import_docs` is enabled, disabled or not set at all.

[import-docs-behavior, cols="^1,^1,4,4"]
|===
| `enabled_shared_bucket_access` | `import_docs` | Behavior (EE) | Behavior (CE)

| true
| not set
| Assumes `import: true` by default
| Assumes `import: false` by default

| true
| false
| Node omitted from import processing (supported for workload isolation)
| Node omitted from import processing

| true
| true
| Node participates in import processing, and is assigned import partitions.
| Node performs import processing for all server mutations.

| false
| not set
| import docs is false by default
| import docs is false by default

| false
| true
| import docs property ignored, warning logged
| import docs property ignored, warning logged

| false
| false
| Import docs is false
| Import docs is false
|===

=== High Availability
In _Enterprise Edition_, import processing work is sharded across all {sgw} nodes with import enabled.
This implies that if one of the nodes fail, the failed shard is automatically picked up by the remaining nodes in the cluster.
This way, you get High Availability of import processing.

In _Community Edition_, there is no sharding of import across the nodes participating in the import processing.
Each import node processes all server mutations.

=== Workload Isolation

As described in the table above, if `import_docs` is set to `false`, the node will not be participating in the import process.
This configuration is specifically recommended for workload isolation: to isolate import nodes from the client-facing nodes.
Workload isolation may be preferable in deployments with high write throughput.

The following diagram shows an example architecture of two {sgw} nodes handling the incoming client connections (`import_docs: false`) and two nodes sharing the import processing (`import_docs: true`).

image:workload-isolation.png[]

// # #### Workload Isolation

// # Starting in version 2.7, if `enable_shared_bucket_access` is set to `true` and `import_docs` is set to `false`, the node will not be participating in the import process.

// # This configuration is specifically recommended for workload isolation: to isolate import nodes from the client-facing nodes. Workload isolation is preferable in deployments with a large write throughput.

// # Prior to Release 2.1 a value of 'continuous' was also allowed. This was deprecated at Release 2.1 and replaced with the boolean value True. There is no change to the behavior or functionality (that is, a value of 'continuous' was interpreted as True and had the same effect).
