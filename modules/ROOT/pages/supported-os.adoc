Sync Gateway is supported on several popular operating systems and virtual environments.

== Supported Versions

Make sure that your chosen operating system or cloud environment is listed in one of the following tables before you install Sync Gateway.
See the <<deprecated-versions>> section for information about platform support changes, including deprecated platforms.

IMPORTANT: Sync Gateway clusters on mixed platforms are not supported.
Nodes in a Sync Gateway cluster should all be running on the same OS, and every effort should be made to apply the same OS patches across the entire cluster.
