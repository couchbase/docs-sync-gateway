== Introduction

Sync Gateway makes collecting performance data easy and secure by providing a Metrics REST API.
This API, separate from both the Public and Admin REST APIs, is available by default on port `4986` -- see <<lbl-act>> for how to change this, if needed.
It exposes Sync Gateway's stats on two endpoints, which deliver the same data in one of two formats:

* The `_metrics` endpoint returns Sync Gateway statistics in {glos-term-prometheus} format. +
For example: `GET host:4986/_metrics` +
+
For information on integration with Prometheus -- see {xref-sgw-pg-stats-prometheus} and our blog entry {url-blog-prometheus}.

* The `_expvars` endpoint returns Sync Gateway statistics in JSON format.
