The API explorer below groups all the endpoints by functionality.
You can click on a label to expand the list of endpoints.

You can also send a request to each endpoint against an instance of Sync Gateway.
To do so, you must enable CORS with the following in the configuration file.
Refer to the Sync Gateway xref:getting-started.adoc[installation guide] for more information on starting a new instance of Sync Gateway.
