*Deprecations*

The following features are being deprecated and will be unsupported in an upcoming version of Sync Gateway.

The recommended approach to perform operations on a bucket dedicated to Couchbase Mobile is to enable xref:shared-bucket-access.adoc[shared bucket access].

*Performance Improvements*

- {url-issues-sync}/716[*#716*] Use sync.atomic to synchronize logging logLevel
- {url-issues-sync}/2396[*#2396*] SyncGateway restart after node automatic failover is taking more time

- {url-issues-sync}/3526[*#3526*] 2.1.0- sg collect info - Show message if sync gateway is not running
- {url-issues-sync}/3584[*#3584*] Sync-gateway does not show any error on logs when used wrong name/value pairs for logging

*Bugs*

- {url-issues-sync}/1574[*#1574*] Windows installer does not start and stop service wrapper
- {url-issues-sync}/2173[*#2173*] Go-couchbase 500 errors when rebalancing
- {url-issues-sync}/3548[*#3548*] Windows logs are written to "Program Files (x86)" when running from "Program Files"

*Known Issues*

- {url-issues-sync}/3562[*#3562*] Sync Gateway requires Couchbase Server nodes to use the same SSL memcached port

== Upgrading

The upgrade from views to GSI (N1QL) happens automatically when starting a Sync Gateway 2.1 node in a cluster that was previously using views.

Installation will follow the same approach implemented in 2.0 for view changes.
On startup, Sync Gateway will check for the existence of the GSI indexes, and only attempt to create them if they do not already exist.
As part of the existence check, Sync Gateway will also check if xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-num_index_replicas[databases.$db.num_index_replicas] for the existing indexes matches the value specified in the configuration file.
If not, Sync Gateway will drop and recreate the index.
Then, Sync Gateway will wait until indexes are available before starting to serve requests.

Sync Gateway 2.1 will *not* automatically remove the previously used design documents.
Removal of the obsolete design documents is done via a call to the new xref:admin-rest-api.adoc#/server/post\__post_upgrade[+/{db}/_post_upgrade+] endpoint in Sync Gateway`'s Admin REST API.
This endpoint can be run in preview mode (`?preview=true`) to see which design documents would be removed.
To summarize, the steps to perform an upgrade to Sync Gateway 2.1 are:

. Upgrade one node in the cluster to 2.1, and wait for it to be reachable via the REST API (for example at \http://localhost:4985/).
. Upgrade the rest of the nodes in the cluster.
. Clean up obsolete views:
** *Optional* Issue a call to `_post_upgrade?preview=true` on any node to preview which design documents will be removed.
To upgrade to 2.1, expect to see "sync_gateway" and "sync_housekeeping" listed.
** Issue a call to `post_upgrade` to remove the obsolete design documents.
The response should indicate that "sync_gateway" and "sync_housekeeping" were removed.
