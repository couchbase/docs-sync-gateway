.Preparatory Steps
NOTE: Before starting the install, please ensure you have read, and acted-upon, the information in {get-started-prepare--xref}.


== Introduction

:param-page: {page-relative-src-path}
include::partial$_get-started-topic-group.adoc[]

In this Getting Started topic we cover how to install the Sync Gateway package on various common platforms and how to check the installation's success.

You can install Sync Gateway on any of the {sgw--xref}{supported-environments--page}[supported operating systems].

On completion of this topic you should have a working Sync Gateway that you can extend and configure to meet your business needs.


== Installation Process
The installation process first deploys the Sync Gateway package, then defines and starts an example instance of Sync Gateway running as a service.

By default Sync Gateway bases its initial setup on an example configuration file `serviceconfig.json`, provided in the `examples` directory.
This initial configuration has limited functionality.
It is intended primarily to verify the success of the installation by proving a connection to Sync Gateway can be made.


== Using Your Own Configuration

Sync Gateway's initial setup uses configuration details from a file its install script creates (`sync_gateway.json`, or `serviceconfig.json` on Windows).

To provide your own configuration to Sync Gateway, you can either:

* Continue to provide your config in the default file.
You will need to restart Sync Gateway after each change.
* Run Sync Gateway from a command-line.
That way you can provide a path to the required config file as a parameter.
* Change the service to use the required configuration file path. +
Instructions on how to do this are given in the _Install_ section for each of the platforms as they differ lightly.

You should refer to the {configuration-overview--xref} for more on the configuration process and to the  {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref} for details on the configuration options.
We also discuss more on the initial configuration in the next Getting Started section -- see: {get-started-verify-install--xref}.
Also, the installation package itself contains example configuration files -- see the appropriate install platform section for details on their location.

[#lbl-linux-run]
=== Run
You can run Sync Gateway as a service, or directly from a command line, using one of the methods show here.


==== Command Line

.Start
[{snippet-header}]
----
// <.>
{install-location-linux}bin/sync_gateway <path-to-configuration-file> // <.>
----

<.> Where `{install-location-linux}` is the location into which you deployed the Sync Gateway package.
<.> Where <path-to-configuration-file> resolves to a JSON format file containing the Sync Gateway configuration, for example, `{home-location-linux}sync-gateway-config.json`

.Stop
{common-text-stop-sgw}


==== Services

.Using systemd
[{snippet-header}]
----
systemctl start sync_gateway
systemctl stop sync_gateway
----

.Using init
[{snippet-header}]
----
service sync_gateway start
service sync_gateway stop
----


[#lbl-linux-owncfg]
=== Configuration
To change the default configuration file path of an existing Sync Gateway service you need to edit the service descriptor.

For `systemd` this will be `sync_gateway.service` in either
`/lib/systemd/system/sync_gateway.service` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system/sync_gateway.service`

You will need to find and replace the path in following line with your required path:
`Environment="CONFIG=/home/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json"`

.One way to do this is to use `systemctl`

. Ensure the new file path includes a useable Sync Gateway configuration file
. Stop the service
. Copy the existing `sync_gateway.service` file to a safe location as a back-up
. Use `sudo systemctl --full edit sync_gateway` to edit the service +
This will create a temporary file in `/etc/systemd/system/sync_gateway.d` containing your changes.
This file is picked-up and applied when the daemon reloads.
Note, `systemctl edit` automatically reloads the edited unit.
. Replace the path in `Environment="CONFIG=/home/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json"` with your required path
. Save the changes +
When the daemon reload completes, Sync Gateway will restart using the required configuration file

[#lbl-windows-owncfg]
=== Configuration
To change the default configuration file path of an existing Sync Gateway service you need to edit the service descriptor.

For Windows, the configuration path is provided as a command line parameter embedded within the `SyncGateway` service's `binpath`.

One way to edit the `binpath` value is to use Windows' _Service Control Manager's_ command line utility `sc.exe config`.
See the <<lbl-syntax>> and an example of the command in use in <<ex-windows-scexe>>.

[#lbl-syntax]
.Syntax of the sc.exe Command
The format of the `sc.exe` command is shown below.
For presentation purposes it is split over several lines.
It should be input as a single line.

[{snippet-header}]
----
sc <remote-server-name> //<.>
  config // <.>
  SyncGateway // <.>
  binpath= <.>
  " // <.>
  [path-to-sg-windows.exe] start [path-to-sync_gateway.exe] // <.>
  [path-to-config-file] // <.>
  [path-to-error-logs] // <.>
  " // <.>
----
<.> Omit the <remote-server-name> parameter if the service is local
<.> Specifies the function we are using, config, in this instance
<.> Identifies the service being changed
<.> Specifies the string value of the path to the binary to be run, and any command line parameters.
The rules for formatting the `binpath` value are quite complex:
** The entire string value must be enclosed in quotes
** There must be one space (only) following the equals sign and none before it
** Each of the [path-to ...] elements must themselves be enclosed in quotes.
These inner quotes must be escaped (for example `\"` ... `\"`)
<.> Opening quotes for the `binpath`, preceded by a single space.
<.> Path to the binaries.
<.> You can provide the required configuration file path name here in the form: +
`\"path/to/file/name.json\"`

<.> You can provide the required log file path name here in the form: +
`\"path/to/file/name.log\"`
<.> Closing quotes for the `binpath`, preceded by a single space.


[#ex-windows-scexe]
.Sample sc.exe Use
====
This example changes the configuration file name from `serviceconfig.json` to `sync-gateway-config.json`

[{snippet-header}]
----
sc config SyncGateway binpath= "\"C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\sg-windows.exe\" start \"C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\sync_gateway.exe\" \"C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\sync-gateway-config.json\" \"C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\var\lib\couchbase\logs\sync_gateway_error.log\""

<.> Here we unload the default sync_gateway service.
Note that it is not sufficient to `stop` the service.
It is configured to automatically restart.

[#lbl-macos-owncfg]
=== Configuration
To change the default configuration file path of an existing Sync Gateway service you need to edit the service descriptor.

For Mac OS this will be the `.plist` file `com.couchbase.mobile.sync_gateway.plist`.

.One way to do this would be:
. Ensure the new file path includes a useable Sync Gateway configuration file
. Within a terminal, stop the service -- see: <<lbl-macos-run, start and stop the service>>
. Copy the existing `com.couchbase.mobile.sync_gateway.plist` file to a safe location as a back-up
. Open the `com.couchbase.mobile.sync_gateway.plist` file in an editor. You will need to use `sudo`
. Within the `ProgramArguments` section of the `.plist`, find and edit the configuration file path, which by default contains:
`<string>/Users/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json</string>`
. Save your changes
. Restart the service  -- see: <<lbl-macos-run, start and stop the service>>


== Check the Install
To check Sync Gateway started successfully, you can now connect to it from a browser by using either:

* http://localhost:4984[http://localhost:4984] for the Public API
* http://localhost:4985[http://localhost:4985] for the Admin API

You should receive a response in the browser such as: +
`{"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"{version}"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/\{version-maint}(145;e3f46be) EE"}`

If you do encounter issues in getting an operational install of Sync Gateway, you can find some useful information in the log files. Refer to the {logging--xref} page for how to configure different logging levels to aid troubleshooting.

== Next Steps
Now that you have a working version of Sync Gateway, which you can connect a console to using either the Public or Admin REST API, you can:

* Verify and explore the sync functionality using -- {get-started-verify-install--xref}
* Learn more about building Couchbase Mobile applications using the {url-tutorial-mobile-workshop} tutorial
* Learn more about the sync process
