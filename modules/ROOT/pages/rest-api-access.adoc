== Overview


Sync Gateway provides secure access to its REST APIs, namely the:

* {rest-api--xref}

* {rest-api-admin--xref} -- for the administration and configuration of {sgw}

* {rest-api-metrics--xref} -- for the monitoring of {sgw} performance metrics

Each REST API is accessed through a different, <<lbl-port-cfg, user-specifiable>>, TCP port.
This makes it easy to control their physical exposure, perhaps to keep the Admin REST API secure behind your firewall.

{sgw-s} {version-full} brings additional optional but default layers of security through {tls-encryption--xref} for all API traffic and Couchbase Server Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization and authentication for all <<lbl-secure-users,Admin and Metrics API users>>.

RBAC user authentication enables <<lbl-secure-users,Secure Administration>> of {sgw} clusters.
This is critical in cloud native deployments.
The use of different RBAC roles for uses also provides secure and fine-grained access control -- for more on the available roles see <<lbl-rbac-roles>>


== TLS


TLS is enforced by default for all Couchbase Server connections in 3.0.
For more on TLS, see: {tls-encryption--xref}.
// It uses credentials provided with the request for authentication.
// The only exception to this is the use of the Public REST API's _GUEST_ mode; which is for use in testing and-or development environments only.


[#lbl-secure-users]
== Secure Administration


// tag::secremacc[]

Secure Administration is *on* by default.

In order to submit Admin or Metrics REST API requests you should create specific Couchbase Server users for that purpose.
You will then provide a valid set of Couchbase Server credentials for these RBAC-users in each API request.

Authenticated users will have access to Admin and-or Metrics API functionality, application data and configuration settings.

// end::secremacc[]


[#lbl-rbac-roles]
== Available Server RBAC Roles on Sync Gateway

Couchbase Server makes a number of RBAC roles available for Sync Gateway use.
Each user's access-level will depend on its allocated role.

The currently available roles will vary depending on the Couchbase Server release version -- see:
<<tbl-ee-svr-sgw-roles>>. +

When referencing the {rest-api-admin--xref} you will see that each endpoint states the role (or roles) able to use it -- you can find a cross-reference of endpoints and required roles in {rest-api-access-rbac-roles--xref}.

Note that the only role available for community-edition users is the *Full Admin* role.

[#lbl-optout]
== Secure Administration Opt-out


You can choose to disable Secure Administration by using these bootstrap configuration settings or CLI flags:

* {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref}
** {bootstrap-schema--xref--api-admin-interface-authentication}
** {bootstrap-schema--xref--api-metrics-interface-authentication}
* {command-line-options--xref}
** `-admin_interface_authentication=false`.
** `-metrics_interface_authentication=false`.


== LDAP Authentication

Authentication against an external system such as LDAP is possible through Couchbase Server.

However, this can increase the risk of performance and or connection issues -- for more on this see the Couchbase Server documentation {server-security-auth-domains--xref-ldap}


[#lbl-port-cfg]
== Port Configuration

You can change the ports used for any of the interface types by editing its bootstrap configuration property, for example, {bootstrap-schema--xref--api-admin-interface} -- as shown in <<ex-port-cfg>> -- and restarting the {sgw} node.
The default ports are shown in <<network-ports>>.

=====

<.> The value of the _interface_ property is a string consisting of a colon followed by a port number (for example, `:4985`).
You can also include a host name or numeric IP address before the colon to bind only to that network interface.
====

As a useful special case, the IP address 127.0.0.1 binds to the loopback interface, making the port unreachable from any other host.
This is the default setting for the admin interface.
