:xref-cb-config: xref:2.5@sync-gateway:ROOT:stats-monitoring.adoc#

Sync Gateway 2.5 includes a number of new metrics available through the Admin REST API (`/_expvars`).
Those new metrics cover performance, resource utilization and health checks of the Sync Gateway nodes which are increasingly important as deployments scale to support a large number of connected Couchbase Lite clients.

The following `curl` command requests the monitoring stats on the Admin REST API.

[source,java]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4985/_expvar" -H "accept: application/json"
----

The response is a JSON object with the following schema.

Insight into total number of channels being cached - provides insight into potential max cache size (num channels * max_cache_size), as well as node usage.

===== chan_cache_removal_revs

Acts as a reminder that removals must be considered when tuning the channel cache size.
Also helps users understand whether they should be tuning tombstone retention policy (metadata purge interval), and running compact.

===== chan_cache_tombstone_revs

The number of tombstone revisions in the channel cache.

Acts as a reminder that tombstones and removals must be considered when tuning the channel cache size.
Also helps users understand whether they should be tuning tombstone retention policy (metadata purge interval), and running compact.

This is the pre-compressed size.

===== attachment_pull_count

Number of attachments pulled.

DCP cache latency = `dcp_caching_time` / `dcp_caching_count`

===== dcp_caching_time

This metric can be used to calculate the time between seeing a change on the DCP feed and when it's available in the channel cache.

DCP cache latency = `dcp_caching_time` / `dcp_caching_count`

===== max_pending

High watermark for number of documents buffered during feed processing, waiting on a missing earlier sequence.

===== num_pull_repl_active_continuous

Gauge representing the number of continuous pull replications in the active state.

===== num_pull_repl_active_one_shot

Gauge representing the number of one-shot pull replications in the active state.

===== num_pull_repl_caught_up

Gauge representing the number of replications which have caught up to the latest changes.

===== num_pull_repl_since_zero

Number of new replications starting per second (`/_changes?since=0`).

===== num_pull_repl_total_continuous

Gauge representing the number of continuous pull replications.

===== num_pull_repl_total_one_shot

===== request_changes_count

This metric can be used to calculate the latency of `_changes` request.

`_changes` request latency = `request_changes_time` / `request_changes_count`

===== request_changes_time

This metric can be used to calculate the latency of `_changes` request.

`_changes` request latency = `request_changes_time` / `request_changes_count`

===== rev_processing_time

The total amount of time processing revisions.

This metric can be used with `rev_send_count` to calculate the average processing time per revision.

average processing time per revision = `rev_processing_time` / `rev_send_count`.

===== rev_send_count

The total amount of time processing revisions.

This metric can be used with `rev_send_count` to calculate the average processing time per revision.

average processing time per revision = `rev_processing_time` / `rev_send_count`.

===== rev_send_latency

In a pull replication, Sync Gateway sends a `/_changes` request to the client.
The client responds with the list of revisions that it wants to receive.

`rev_send_latency` is measuring the time between the client asking for some revisions via the `/_changes` response, and Sync Gateway sending that revision to the client.

NOTE: Measuring time from the `/_changes` response means that this stat will vary significantly depending on the changes batch size.
A larger batch size will result in a spike of this stat, even if the processing time per revision is unchanged.
A more useful stat might be the average processing time per revision (xref:#rev_processing_time[rev_processing_time] / xref:#rev_send_count[rev_send_count]).

==== database

Stats relative to the database

===== crc32c_match_count

Count of instances during import when the document cas had changed, but the document body was not changed.

===== dcp_caching_count

===== dcp_caching_time

Time between DCP mutation arriving at Sync Gateway and being added to channel cache (aggregate).

===== dcp_received_count

Number of document mutations received by Sync Gateway over DCP.

===== dcp_received_time

Time between document write and document being received by Sync Gateway over DCP.  If the document was written prior to Sync Gateway starting the feed, is measured as the time since the feed was started.  Can be used to monitor DCP feed processing latency.

===== doc_reads_bytes_blip

===== doc_writes_bytes

Total number of bytes written as part of document writes since Sync Gateway startup.
