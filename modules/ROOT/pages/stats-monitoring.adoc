== Introduction

Deployments are increasingly scaling to support large numbers of connected mobile and edge clients.
This places added emphasis on the effective  monitoring of the health and performance of Sync Gateway nodes.

Sync Gateway's Metrics REST API_ facilitates the process of gathering this essential data by providing access to node metrics covering:

* Performance
* Resource utilization
* Health

It also provides for integration with Prometheus.

Use the Metrics REST API to request the statistics in either xref:stats-monitoring-json.adoc[JSON] or xref:stats-monitoring-prometheus.adoc[Prometheus] format.


== Advantages of JSON format

The custom xref:stats-monitoring-json.adoc[JSON] format was created specifically to describe Sync Gateway metrics, and provides rich, nested data.

== Advantages of Prometheus format
