== Guaranteed Availability

Prior to 2.1, Sync Gateway used system views for a variety of internal operations, including authentication and replication.
Starting in 2.1, Sync Gateway will use GSI and N1QL to perform those tasks.

== X.509 Authentication against Couchbase Server

Sync Gateway adds the ability to use X.509 certificates to authenticate against Couchbase Server 5.5 or higher.
This functionality can be used instead or in addition to the existing authentication method which is to specify a username and password in the configuration file.

== Continuous Logging

Continuous logging is a new feature in Sync Gateway 2.1 that provides more flexibility in how logs are generated and retained, whilst maintaining the level of logging required by Couchbase Support for investigation of issues.

Sync Gateway logging is now written to separate files by log level, with each log level supporting individual retention policies.

Console logging can also be configured independently, providing additional flexibility for system administrators depending on their needs.

The previous logging configuration (`logging.default`) is being deprecated, and Sync Gateway 2.1 will display warnings on startup of what is required to update your configuration.
Detailed information about continuous logging can be found in the xref:logging.adoc[Logging guide].

=== SGCollect Info

xref:sgcollect-info.adoc[`sgcollect_info`] has been updated to use the continuous logging feature introduced in 2.1, and collects the four leveled files (*sg_error.log*, *sg_warn.log*, *sg_info.log* and *sg_debug.log*).

These new log files are rotated and compressed by Sync Gateway, so `sgcollect_info` decompresses these rotated logs, and concatenates them back into a single file upon collection.

For example, if you have *sg_debug.log*, and *sg_debug-2018-04-23T16-57-13.218.log.gz* and then run `sgcollect_info` as normal, both of these files get put into a *sg_debug.log* file inside the zip output folder.

== Log Redaction

All log outputs can be redacted, this means that user-data, considered to be private, is removed.
This feature is optional and can be enabled in the configuration with the xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-redaction_level[`logging.redaction_level`] property.

=== SGCollect Info

`sgcollect_info` now supports log redaction post-processing.
In order to utilize this, Sync Gateway needs to be run with the `logging.redaction_level` property set to "partial".

Two new command line options have been added to `sgcollect_info`:

* `--log-redaction-level=REDACT_LEVEL`: redaction level for the logs collected, `none` and `partial` supported. Defaults to `none`.
+
When `--log-redaction-level` is set to partial, two zip files are produced, and tagged contents in the redacted one should be hashed in the same way as `cbcollect_info`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./sgcollect_info --log-redaction-level=partial sgout.zip
...
Zipfile built: sgout-redacted.zip
Zipfile built: sgout.zip
----

* `--log-redaction-salt=SALT_VALUE`: salt used in the hashing of tagged data when enabling redaction. Defaults to a random uuid.

== Bucket operation timeout

The xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-bucket_op_timeout_ms[`databases.$db.bucket_op_timeout_ms`] property to override the default timeout used by Sync Gateway to query Couchbase Server.
It's generally not necessary to change this property unless there is a particularly heavy load on Couchbase Server which would increase the response time.

== Support for IPv6

Sync Gateway now officially supports IPv6.

== Release Notes
