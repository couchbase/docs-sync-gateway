== Views to GSI

Sync Gateway has been using system views for a variety of internal functions, including authentication and replication.
Starting in 2.1, Sync Gateway will use GSI and N1QL to perform those tasks.
The advantage of using GSI is that you can now support replicas of index node, there by reducing the downtime during a server upgrade, rebalance or failover from several hours to a few seconds.
This change also improves overall query performance.
Note that this only impacts system views.
Users can continue to define views through the xref:admin-rest-api.adoc#/query[Sync Gateway Admin REST API].
This capability is enabled by default and there are 2 properties in the configuration file which can be adjusted:

* xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-use_views[`databases.$db.use_views`]
* xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-num_index_replicas[`databases.$db.num_index_replicas`]

== X.509 Authentication against Couchbase Server

Sync Gateway adds the ability to use x.509 certificates to authenticate against Couchbase Server 5.5 or higher.

Certificate based authentication provides an additional layer of security; it relies on a certificate authority, CA, to validate identities and issue certificates. To enable certificate based authentication on Sync Gateway, paths to the client certificate, private key and root CA must be set in the configuration file:

* xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-certpath[databases.$db.certpath]
* xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-keypath[databases.$db.keypath]
* xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-cacertpath[databases.$db.cacertpath]

Instructions to generate the client certificate, private key and root CA can be found in xref:5.5@server:security:security-x509certsintro.adoc[x.509 for TLS].

This functionality provides an alternative method of authentication to the existing password-based authentication method.

If the **username**/**password** properties are also specified in the configuration file then Sync Gateway will use password-based authentication and also include the client certificate in the TLS handshake.

== Continuous Logging

Continuous logging is a new feature in Sync Gateway 2.1 that allows the console log output to be separated from log files collected by Couchbase Support.

This allows system administrators running Sync Gateway to tweak log level, and log keys for the console output to suit their needs, whilst maintaining the level of logging required by Couchbase Support for investigation of issues.

The previous logging configuration (`logging.default`) is being deprecated, and Sync Gateway 2.1 will display warnings on startup of what is required to update your configuration.
Detailed information about continuous logging can be found in the xref:logging.adoc[Logging guide].

=== SGCollect Info

xref:sgcollect-info.adoc[`sgcollect_info`] has been updated to use the continuous logging feature introduced in 2.1, and collects the four leveled files (*sg_error.log*, *sg_warn.log*, *sg_info.log* and *sg_debug.log*).

These new log files are rotated and compressed by Sync Gateway, so `sgcollect_info` decompresses these rotated logs, and concatenates them back into a single file upon collection.

For example, if you have *sg_debug.log*, and *sg_debug-2018-04-23T16-57-13.218.log.gz* and then run `sgcollect_info` as normal, both of these files get put into a *sg_debug.log* file inside the zip output folder.

== Log Redaction

All log outputs can be redacted, this means that user-data, considered to be private, is removed.
This feature is optional and can be enabled in the configuration with the xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-redaction_level[`logging.redaction_level`] property.

=== SGCollect Info

`sgcollect_info` now supports log redaction post-processing.
In order to utilize this, Sync Gateway needs to be run with the `logging.redaction_level` property set to "partial".

Two new command line options have been added to `sgcollect_info`:

* `--log-redaction-level=REDACT_LEVEL`: redaction level for the logs collected, `none` and `partial` supported. Defaults to `none`.
+
When `--log-redaction-level` is set to partial, two zip files are produced, and tagged contents in the redacted one should be hashed in the same way as `cbcollect_info`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./sgcollect_info --log-redaction-level=partial sgout.zip
...
Zipfile built: sgout-redacted.zip
Zipfile built: sgout.zip
----

* `--log-redaction-salt=SALT_VALUE`: salt used in the hashing of tagged data when enabling redaction. Defaults to a random uuid.

== Bucket operation timeout

The xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-bucket_op_timeout_ms[`databases.$db.bucket_op_timeout_ms`] property to override the default timeout used by Sync Gateway to query Couchbase Server.
It's generally not necessary to change this property unless there is a particularly heavy load on Couchbase Server which would increase the response time.

== Support for IPv6

Sync Gateway now officially supports IPv6.

== Release Notes

This release contains a number of bug fixes and enhancements for Couchbase Lite.
