== Delta Sync

This release adds delta sync support in replications between Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway.
Delta Sync is the ability to replicate only parts of the Couchbase mobile document that have changed.
This can result in significant savings in bandwidth consumption as well as throughput improvements, especially when network bandwidth is typically constrained.
