== Concept
// tag::full[]
// tag::summary[]

Roles are named collections of {channels--xref}.
They enable the grouping together of {users--xref} with similar characteristics, which makes the management of large user populations easier.

Roles are granted access to channels. Any user assigned a role can access any channels (and documents within those channels) the role has been granted access to.

As an entity, roles comprise a name and a list of channels.

Any user associated with a role inherits the right to access any of the channels in the role’s list. This provides a convenient way to associate multiple channels with multiple users.

TIP: Roles have a separate namespace from users, so it’s possible to have a user and a role with the same name.
