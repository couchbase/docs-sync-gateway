== Concept

// tag::full[]
// tag::summary[]
Users are one of the cornerstone concepts of access control.
You can restrict document access to specific users and-or to users with specific roles.

// end::summary[]

As an entity a _user_ comprises a name, password, list of {roles--xref} and a list of {channels--xref}.

Sync Gateway users and roles have no relationship to Couchbase Server's _RBAC (Role-based Access Control) users_ -- see: {server-security-auth-overview--xref} for more on RBAC.

Users that are granted access to a channel are able to access the documents assigned to that channel.

Users can also be assigned to zero or more roles.
A user inherits the channel access of all roles it belongs to.
This is very much like Unix groups, except that roles do not form a hierarchy.
