== Concept
// tag::full[]
// tag::summary[]

You control document access by routing it to a channel and by making that channel accessible to the users or roles you want to be able to access documents of that type.

// end::summary[]
// tag::body[]
== Model
In the Couchbase Mobile ecosystem access to documents is governed by three key entities: {sgw--xref}{users--page}[users], {sgw--xref}{roles--page}[roles] and {sgw--xref}{channels--page}[channels].

[#img-access-control-model]
.Access Control Model
image:access-control-triangle.png[Access,400]

Conceptually, the _channel_ can be considered as a _tag_ associated with a document.
Every document processed by the Sync Gateway is assigned to a channel (user-defined or system-defined).
A channel is the fundamental way to segregate documents and for enforcing access control.

Every Sync Gateway user is granted access to zero, one or more channels.
It is the channels membership that determines the documents users can access -- as illustrated in <<img-access-control-model>>

A Sync Gateway role is a way of logically grouping users.
Like the channel, a role is granted access to zero, one or more channels.

A user can only read documents that are in at least one of their assigned channels; whether directly or as part of an assigned role.

[#ex-sync-function-model]
== Sync Function Examples

Couchbase Sync Gateway defines a Sync Function at the `collection` level. 
Defining at this level helps simplify data management and improve data reliability. 
Each collection in the system allows for only one Sync Function, which enables the specification of Access Control rules.

.Default Sync Function
====

=====
--

[source, javascript]
----
function (doc, oldDoc, meta) { 
   channel(CollectionName); 

}
----
Here the function then calls the `channel` and passes in the name of the collection `(CollectionsName)` as an argument.

By default, every document in the collection is automatically assigned to a channel with the same name as the collection. This system automatically creates a channel with the collection's name. The assignment of all documents to the collection channel is functionally similar to assigning them to the xref:2.7@sync-gateway-channels.adoc#star-channel[Star Channel].

To override this, use a custom sync function or a Specified Default Sync Function.

.Upgraded Default Sync Function
====

=====
--

[source, javascript]
----
function (doc, oldDoc, meta) {
   channel(doc.channels);

} 
----
Here is the default Sync Function when you have upgraded; it remains the same as the previous version.

== Context
You control document access by routing it to a channel and by making that channel accessible to the users or roles you want to be able to access documents of that type.


=== Sync Gateway

All users can implicitly access any document in the public channel.
In addition, there can be user-defined channels that users can be assigned to.

Once a user is granted access to a new channel, the next replication pull request from the client will retrieve all documents to which the user now has access.

Revoking access to a channel means that users who previously used the channel to get replicated documents will no longer see any synced updates.

Note that access grants neither confer, nor constrain, the *type* of access.
Instead you can explicitly implement write access controls within the Sync Function; perhaps restricting updates to specific users or roles — for more on this see {access-control-how-control-document-access--xref-write-access}.


=== Couchbase Lite

By default, Couchbase Lite gets all the channels to which the configured user account has access.
Optionally, a Couchbase Lite "pull" replication can also specify a comma-separated list of channel names to receive documents from.
In this case, the replication from Sync Gateway will only pull documents tagged with those channels.
Client apps can use this ability to intelligently sync with a subset of the available documents from the database.

[#lbl-access-revocation]
== Channel Access Revocation

.3.0 Breaking Change
[NOTE]
Whenever a user loses access to a channel (or channels) all document in the channel(s) are auto-purged from local Couchbase Lite databases. +
In {Sgw-te} 2.x these documents remain in the local database on channel access loss.

Users may lose access to documents for many reasons, including:

* The User loses direct access to channel
* The User is removed from a role
* A role the user belongs to is revoked access to channel

By default, when a user loses access to a channel, the next Couchbase Lite Pull replication auto-purges all documents in the channel from local Couchbase Lite databases (on devices belonging to the user) *unless* they belong to any of the user’s other channels -- see: <<tbl-sgw-behavior>>.

== Provisioning

* {channel--xref} -- the channels topic discusses how channels are created and how documents can be assigned to channels.

* {user--xref} -- the user topic discusses provisioning of users and providing users access to channels.

* {role--xref} -- the role topic discusses roles, assignment of users to roles created and providing roles access to channels.


// == Use

// There are a number of ways in which you can control access to documents, as illustrated in <<img-channel-access>>.

// * Configuration -- You can do it in the {configuration-schema-database--xref} by adding the appropriate channel to the user's `admin_channels` property in the  see {configuration-schema-database--xref--user-admin-channels}

// * Admin REST API -- You can provide that same `admin_channels` property using the *Admin REST API* endpoint ({rest-api-admin-user-put--xref}).

// * Programmatically -- The {sync-function--xref} provides a flexible and secure method for controlling document access and routing.
// +
// It can be programmed to derive appropriate access and routing information from document properties or, more securely, from a designated extended attribute (XATTR) -- see: {access-control-how-use-xattrs-for-access-grants--xref} for how to define the XATTR.


// [#img-channel-access]
// .Access Control Points
// ====

// image::channel-access-grant-all.png["Channel access",300]

// <.> Documents are assigned to channel using the Sync Function's {sync-function-api-channel-cmd--xref} API.

// <.> User can be granted access to channels by any one of the means defined here.

// ====

// == Example

// Consider the situation where two roles require, and are allowed, access to two distinct information flows and one shared flow -- see <<img-channels-example>>.

// This can be achieved by:

// . Creating two roles (Edge1 and Edge2) for the two groups of users.
// +
// --
// Do this either by using the Admin REST API endpoint  {rest-api-admin-role-post--xref} or statically by adding the role to the database in the {configuration-schema-database--xref}.
// In either case specify that role Edge1 can access `Channel1`, Edge2 can access `Channel2`, and both roles can access & `Channel3` -- see: {access-control-how-create-roles--xref}
// --

// . Adding the roles to the appropriate users, again using either the configuration file or API -- see {access-control-how-assign-users-to-roles--xref}

// . Creating a Sync Function that

// ** Identifies and assigns appropriate documents to the right channel (or channels)
// ** Requires that any user accessing those channels has the right to do so; either directly or as in this case through a role assigned to them(Edge1 or Edge2).


// [#img-channels-example]
// .Access Control Example
// ====
// This example shows three channels; one shared and two private.
// Here {Edge1} and {Edge2} represent two groups of Sync Gateway users with the assigned roles Edge1 and Edge2 respectively.

// image::channels-example-all.png[Channels,400]

// <.> Documents are routed to the appropriate channels by Sync Function logic
// <.> The Sync Function requires users (or one of their roles) has access to the channel
