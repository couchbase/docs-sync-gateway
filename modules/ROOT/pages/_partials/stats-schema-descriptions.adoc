==== rev_send_count
Description::

Use Case::

==== rev_send_latency
Description::
The total amount of time between Sync Gateway receiving a request for a revision and that revision being sent.
+
In a pull replication, Sync Gateway sends a `/_changes` request to the client and the client responds with the list of revisions it wants to receive.
+
So, `{rev_send_latency}` measures the time between the client asking for those revisions and Sync Gateway sending them to the client.

Use Case::
This metric gives the time taken to respond to a `/ changes` request.

Constraints::
--
The derived value includes latency associated with processing other revisions in the same batch.

Measuring time from the `/_changes` response means that this stat will vary significantly depending on the changes batch size
A larger batch size will result in a spike of this stat, even if the processing time per revision is unchanged.

A more useful stat might be the average processing time per revision:

`average processing time per revision` = `{rev_processing_time}`] / `{rev_send_count}`

+
--
Assessing the number of redundant requested changes being pushed by the client.

Do this by comparing the {propose_change_count} value with the number of actual writes {num_doc_writes}, which could indicate that clients are pushing changes already known to Sync Gateway.
--

+
NOTE: P2P synchronizations will typically show a higher incidences of rejected proposed changes.

==== propose_change_time

==== sync_function_time
Description::
The total time spent evaluating the sync_function.
Use Case::
The {sync_function_time} stat can be useful when:

 stat value
* Assessing the benefit of adding additional Sync Gateway nodes, as it can point to Sync Gateway being a bottleneck
* Troubleshooting slow push replication, in which case it ought to be considered in conjunction with {sync_function_time}.
