// Concept = Node Distribution
// tag::description[]
// tag::summary[]
The goal of node distribution is to maintain an optimal balance of replications across the cluster.,with any given replication runs on only one node at any give time.
// end::summary[]

To achieve this Sync Gateway automatically balances, as equally as possible, the number of replications running on each node.

Where multiple replications are configured on multiple nodes, Sync Gateway automatically distributes these replications across all the available nodes for which the replications are configured.
It continually monitors and redistributes replications as the number of available nodes and the number of running replications in a cluster changes.

The nodes' processing load and bandwidth usage is minimized by ensuring that a replicator runs on only one node at any given time -- even where it has been configured to run on multiple nodes.
This avoids the redundant exchange of data arising from duplicate replication.

// Sync Gateway selects the node to run a replication on is selected by an election process. It uses a heartbeat check to establish whether a node is available or not.
// If it isn't it will try the next node in the configured set.

// Monitoring the node heartbeats is also the trigger for the re-balancing of running replications as it
