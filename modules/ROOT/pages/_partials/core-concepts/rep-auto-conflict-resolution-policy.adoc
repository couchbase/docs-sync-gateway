The automatic conflict resoluton policy will return the most recent change as the winning revision unless one of the revisions was a delete; in which case the delete wins. If both revisions are equally recent then the largest change wins.

The default {glos-term-auto-conflict-resolution} policy always returns a winner determined by the following rules:

* If one of the changes is a delete:
+
A deleted document (that is, a {glos-term-tombstone-revision}) always wins over a document update.
* If both changes are document changes:
+
The change with the most revisions (the longest revision history) will win.
Typically, this is the revision with the highest version number.
* If both changes have the same number of revisions:
An ASCII comparison of the revisions is done to pick the winner.
