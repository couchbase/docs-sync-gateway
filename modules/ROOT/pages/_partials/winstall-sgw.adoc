You can start Sync Gateway from the command line -- see: {command-line-options--xref} or run it as a service.
Either way, once it starts running you can access the REST API on:

* `+http://localhost:4984+` -- public API
* `+http://localhost:4985+` -- admin API

+
To stop/start the service, you can use the Services application (*Control Panel -> Admin Tools -> Services*).

* The configuration file is located under `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\serviceconfig.json`.
* Logs are located under `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\var\lib\couchbase\logs`.
