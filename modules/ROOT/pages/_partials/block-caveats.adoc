.Couchbase Server Bucket Types
[NOTE]
Use only *Couchbase* bucket types in _Couchbase for Mobile and Edge_.
We do not support the use of Couchbase Server's *Ephemeral* or *Memcached* bucket types -- for more on bucket types see:  Couchbase Server xref:server:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[bucket types].

// end::ephemeral-buckets[]

// tag::cbs6.0ke-xattrs[]
[NOTE]
--
Users of Couchbase Server 6.0 should ensure they have addressed the known issue (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41255[MB-41255]) by upgrading to one of the recommended Couchbase Server versions (6.0.5, 6.5.2, or 6.6.1).

The known issue can cause rebalance failures and/or failed replica writes of deleted or expired documents that use Xattrs.

This impacts Sync Gateway deployments running with shared bucket access enabled, which use xattrs for metadata storag.

.Constraints
[NOTE]
--
Do not use the `logs` directory as a storage location for files that should not be there. Permission issues with those files can prevent Sync Gateway from starting.
