// inclusion for prometheus dev preview

.Prometheus Monitoring Support
[NOTE]
--
This is a Developer Preview feature, not intended for production use; the API is uncommitted.

In addition to the Admin API's `expvar` endpoint, you can now try the *developer preview* of Sync Gateway's Metrics REST API, which exposes those same statistics in a Prometheus-compatible format -- see {rest-api-metrics--xref}.

For more information on using _Prometheus_ and _Grafina_ with Sync Gateway -- see our blog entry {url-blog-prometheus}.
