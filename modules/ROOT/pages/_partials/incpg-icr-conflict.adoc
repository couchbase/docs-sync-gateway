// = Conflict Resolution in Inter-sync-gateway Replication
:fn-no-op-text: footnote:fn-1[No-op update -- refers to a change to the document body that has no impact on the app logic but will trigger an import by the Sync Gateway. One option could be to include a property used specifically for this purpose (i.e. a counter that can be incremented in response to conflict resolver errors).]

== Automatic Conflict Resolution
// tag::overview[]
Inter-Sync-Gateway Replication supports automatic conflict resolution to resolve conflicting document changes.

It delivers this by applying one of its built-in {glos-term-conflict-resolver-policies}, which can be easily included in your own replications -- see <<configuring-a-policy-to-use>>

include::{concepts}rep-auto-conflict-resolution.adoc[]

:param-msg: A CUSTOM resolver policy is available. +
It provides additional flexibility allowing users to provide their own resolution logic -- see <<custom-conflict-resolution-ee, Custom Conflict Resolver>>.
include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=ee-only]

// end::overview[]

// See: <<resolver-policies, conflict resolver policies>>

Conflict Response on Active Replicator::
As soon as the _active_ Sync Gateway database detects a conflict in a replicated document revision, it initiates its configured _conflict resolver policy_ to determine a _winning_ revision.
This policy assesses the conflicting revisions and either determines the winning revision or returns an error if it fails while doing so.

Conflict Response by Passive Replicator::
When a passive Sync Gateway database detects a conflict it responds to the active with a `409` response and rejects the revision. The active Sync Gateway will then apply its specified conflict resolver policy.

// === Automatic Resolution Policy

// * Deletes always win.


//  even when the no-conflicts mode is enabled (that is where xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-allow_conflicts["allow_conflicts": false]).

// When running two Sync Gateway clusters with the no-conflicts mode enabled, cross-cluster document conflicts will result in that document no longer being replicated. To avoid this, the application must ensure that concurrent cross-cluster updates are not made to a given document.

// Deployments  must implement a custom conflict resolver in an external app as specified in {xref-sgw-pg-resolving-conflicts}.

// == Conflict Resolver Policies

// Conflict resolution is configurable, in that you can choose to apply one of the out-of-the-box (predefined) conflict resolver policies.

// [#predefined-resolver-policies]
// .Predefined resolver policies
// The following automatic conflict resolution policies are available when configuring a replication:

// Default::
// Applies the default policy described in <<automatic-conflict-resolution>>

// Local Wins::
// * Always considers the local change the winner.
// * Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "localWins"`

// Remote Wins::
// Always considers the remote change the winner.
// * Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "remoteWins"`

== How Resolution Works

Pull Replications::
+
--
For _Pull_ replications the _active_ Sync Gateway is responsible for detecting and resolving conflicts based on the configured _conflict_resolution_type_ (see configuration item: {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-conflict}.

This is also how conflicts are handled when Couchbase Lite clients pull down documents to Sync Gateway.

*Note:* Resolved conflicts are only transferred from active to passive Sync Gateways if a replication is setup between them.
--

Push Replications::
+
--
Passive Sync Gateway::
The _passive_ Sync Gateway will automatically detect and reject conflicting revisions being _pushed_ to it.
+
Note that conflicts are not resolved.
The revision is rejected and the document returned -- with a `409 Conflict` -- response to the active Sync Gateway.

Active Sync Gateway::
It is  the responsibility of the active sync Gateway to address rejected revisions in accordance with its specified _conflict_resolution_type_.
--
+
This approach is the same as that adopted when Couchbase Lite clients push documents to Sync Gateway.

== Configure Conflict Resolution
Invoke automatic conflict resolution by specifying the required _conflict resolver policy_ in the {glos-term-replication-definition}.
The specified policy is applied whenever a conflict is detected.

=====
// Inter-sync-gateway Replication (v2) supports automatic conflict resolution to resolve conflicting document revisions.

// The automatic conflict resolution policy is the same as that adopted in Couchbase Lite 2.x between Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway.
// The basic rules being:

// include::couchbase-lite:ROOT:partial$handling-conflicts.adoc[tags=auto-conflict-resolution]

== Build a Conflict Resolution Policy [EE]
// _In this section_: <<conflict-resolution-approaches>>  |  <<approaches-to-error-handling>>  |  <<conflict-resolver-structure>>

include::partial$incpg-icr-conflict-build-custom.adoc[]




// include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=ee-only]

// Custom conflict resolution is handled by the _active_ Sync Gateway using a user-provided _custom conflict resolver_. This Javascript function is embedded in the replication configuration.

// The predefined conflict resolver policies are also available as Javascript functions that you can call from within that _custom_conflict_resolver_ function

// You can invoke the non-custom built-in resolver policies from within your resolver function. This is useful when you want to apply greater selectivity to the automatic conflict resolution process. For example, you want to apply the `remoteWins` policy only for a specific type of document - see <<use-policies, Use Policies>> tab in <<simple-conflict-resolvers>>.

// === Conflict Resolution Approaches

// There are two ways to handle conflicts in your custom_conflict_resolver, you can either:

// * Choose a _winning_ revision from among the conflicting revisions (see <<simple-conflict-resolvers>>), or
// * Merge conflicting revision to create a new _winning_ revision; losing revisions are tomb-stoned.
// +
// However, user are cautioned against using complex resolver logic as it can have a significant impact on performance.

// === Approaches to Error Handling

// // tag::overview-error-handling[]
// The custom conflict resolver function should not terminate the replication when it encounters exceptions or errors _pull_ replication.
// Instead it should provide sufficient information to aid troubleshooting and recovery.

// For example, your custom conflict resolver function should:

// * Skip the document causing the issue
// * Log a suitable warning level message.
// Include at least the skipped document's Id and the sequence Id of the revision in error.
// // end::overview-error-handling[]

// Refer to log files when troubleshooting conflict resolution errors, to identify the document id and revision sequence in error.

// .Some Error Scenarios and Recommended Resolutions
// ====

// Unexpected data in the remote document::
// You should update the remote document to fix the issue.
// Doing so will cause replication of the update.

// Unexpected data in the local document::
// You should update the local document to fix the issue.
// This will not trigger a pull-replication.
// Do a no-op-update {fn-no-op-text} of the remote document, which will trigger replication and conflict resolution.

// Fault in conflict resolution javascript function::
// +
// --
// Fix the Javascript logic and then either:

// * Do a _no op update_ {fn-no-op} of the remote document.
// This triggers a pull replication and subsequent conflict resolution.

// * Reset the replication (using `_replicationstatus/reset` endpoint). Not recommended as it introduces significant duplicate processing in re-syncing previously synced documents.
