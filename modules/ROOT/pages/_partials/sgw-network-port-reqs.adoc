Sync Gateway uses specific ports for communication with the outside world, mostly Couchbase Lite databases replicating to and from Sync Gateway -- see <<network-ports>> for details.

|Port |Description

|4984
|Public port.
External HTTP port used for replication with Couchbase Lite databases and other applications accessing the REST API on the Internet.

The Public REST API is used for client replication. The default port for the Public REST API is 4984.

|4985
|Admin port.
Internal HTTP port for unrestricted access to the database and to run administrative tasks.

The Admin REST API is used to administer user accounts and roles. It can also be used to look at the contents of databases in superuser mode. The default port for the Admin REST API is 4985. By default, the Admin REST API is reachable only from localhost for safety reasons.

|4986
|Metrics port.
By default `4986` is the internal HTTP port designated for providing access to Sync Gateway's Metrics REST API.
Like the admin port, it is bound to `127.0.0.1` by default.

The Metrics REST API returns Sync Gateway metrics, in JSON and-or Prometheus-compatible formats, for performance monitoring and-or diagnostic purposes,
