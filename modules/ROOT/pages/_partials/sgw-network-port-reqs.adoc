|Port |Description

|4984
|Public port.
External HTTP port used for replication with Couchbase Lite databases and other applications accessing the REST API on the Internet.

The Public REST API is used for client replication. The default port for the Public REST API is 4984.

|4985
|Admin port.
Internal HTTP port for unrestricted access to the database and to run administrative tasks.

The Admin REST API is used to administer user accounts and roles. It can also be used to look at the contents of databases in superuser mode. The default port for the Admin REST API is 4985. By default, the Admin REST API is reachable only from localhost for safety reasons.
