The Sync Function is a JavaScript function whose source code is stored in the Sync Gateway's database configuration file. You can learn more about this property ($db.sync) in the Configuration Schema Reference -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-databases-sync}.

The sync function is called every time a new revision/update is made to a document, and the changes to channels and access made by the sync function are _tied to that revision_.
If the document is later updated, the sync function will be called again on the new revision, and the new channel assignments and user/channel access _replace_ the ones from the first call.

It can do the following things:

* Validate documents -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-write-access-data-val}
// xref:write-access.adoc#data-validation[Write Access -- data validation]
* Authorize changes -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-write-access-authchange}
// xref:write-access.adoc#write-access[Write Access -- authorize the change]
* Grant user access to channels -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-read-access-add}
// xref:read-access.adoc#add-access[Read Access -- add access]
* Assign documents to channels -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-sync-gateway-channels-add}

For simple applications it might be the only server-side code you need to write.
For more complex applications it is still a primary touchpoint for managing data routing and access control.
