== Shared Bucket Access
:pageOriginRel: "sg=1.5, Cbs=5.0)_"

Sync Gateway uses the _Shared Bucket Access_ feature to synchronize document changes made through Couchbase SDKs and N1QL queries with Couchbase Lite clients, and vice versa.
The following diagram shows different client types (mobile, web, desktop) writing data to the same bucket in Couchbase Server.

image::shared-bucket-access.png[]

In previous releases, you either had to ensure all writes happened through Sync Gateway, or had to set up bucket shadowing to ensure that the security and replication metadata needed by mobile applications was preserved.

As of Sync Gateway 1.5, the metadata created by the Sync Gateway is abstracted from applications reading and writing data directly to Couchbase Server.
Sync Gateway 1.5 utilizes a new feature of Couchbase Server 5.0 called XATTRs (e**X**tended **ATTR**ibutes) to store that metadata into an external document fragment.

== How to enable it

Shared bucket access is an opt-in feature, and can be enabled without bringing down the entire Sync Gateway cluster.

The xref::gs-sgw-svr-cfg.adoc#step-2create-rbac-user[Configure Server for Sync Gateway] page includes step-by-step instructions to:

. Install Couchbase Server 5.0 or above.
. Configure an appropriately empowered RBAC user in Couchbase Server.
. Install Sync Gateway with a configuration file that enables Mobile-Web data synchronization.

<1> The `enable_shared_bucket_access` property is used to enable Web-Server data sync and must be `_true_` on all nodes participating in such a configuration.
<2> The `import_docs` property is used to specify that a Sync Gateway node should (only) import document changes using the <<Import process>>.

Once enabled, documents can be inserted on the Server directly (using _N1QL_ or _SDKs_) or through the xref:rest-api.adoc[Sync Gateway REST API].
The mobile metadata is no longer kept in the document, but in a system extended attribute in Couchbase Server.

== Import process

The import process is a key part of mobile convergence.

It is the means by which Sync Gateway becomes aware of non-Sync Gateway data changes and obtains the mobile metadata it requires to replicate changes.
Any link:glossary.adoc#non-sync-gateway[non-Sync Gateway change] is eligible for import.

The document is first run through the Sync Function to compute read security and routing, with the following differences:

- The import is processed with an admin user context in the Sync Function, similar to writes made through the Sync Gateway Admin API.
This means that `requireAccess`, `requireUser` and `requireRole` calls in the Sync Function are treated as no-ops.
- During import, `oldDoc` is `nil` when the Sync Function is executed.

You can specify a filter function using the xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db_import_filter[import_filter]  property, which will only import specific documents.

TIP: Use the xref:config-properties.adoc#log[Import+] log key to troubleshoot import processing issues in the logs.

== Configuration

Note that `import_docs` only takes effect if the `enabled_shared_bucket_access` is set to `true`.

Starting in Release 2.7, `import_docs` defaults to `true` for Enterprise Edition.
This implies that by default, all Enterprise Edition nodes in a cluster will participate in import processing.
In order to exclude a node, the `import_docs` flag must be `false`.
This `import_docs` flag must be explicitly set to `true` in Community Edition.


The following table describes the key behavior differences between Community Edition and Enterprise Edition when `import_docs` is enabled, disabled or not set at all.

|===
| `enabled_shared_bucket_access` | `import_docs` | Behavior (EE) | Behavior (CE)

| true
| not set
| Assumes `import: true` by default
| Assumes `import: false` by default

| true
| false
| Node omitted from import processing (supported for workload isolation)
| Node omitted from import processing

| true
| true
| Node participates in import processing, and is assigned import partitions.
| Node performs import processing for all server mutations.

| false
| not set
| import docs is false by default
| import docs is false by default

| false
| true
| import docs property ignored, warning logged
| import docs property ignored, warning logged

| false
| false
| Import docs is false
| Import docs is false
|===

== High Availability of Import processing

In _Enterprise Edition_, import processing work is sharded across all Sync Gateway nodes with import enabled.
This implies that if one of the nodes fail, the failed shard is automatically picked up by the remaining nodes in the cluster.
This way, you get High Availability of import processing.

In _Community Edition_, there is no sharding of import across the nodes participating in the import processing. Each import node processes all server mutations.



== Workload Isolation

As described in the table above, if `import_docs` is set to `false`, the node will not be participating in the import process.
This configuration is specifically recommended for workload isolation: to isolate import nodes from the client-facing nodes.
Workload isolation may be preferable in deployments with high write throughput.

The following diagram shows an example architecture of two Sync Gateway nodes handling the incoming client connections (`import_docs: false`) and two nodes sharing the import processing (`import_docs: true`).

== Metadata Purge Interval

When link:config-properties.html#databases-foo_db-enable_shared_bucket_access[$dbname.enable_shared_bucket_access] is enabled, xref:glossary.adoc[mobile tombstones] are *not* retained indefinitely.
They are purged based on the server's _metadata purge interval_.
To ensure tombstones are replicated to clients, you should set the server's metadata purge interval based on your expected replication frequency (see the link:config-properties.html#databases-foo_db-enable_shared_bucket_access[$dbname.enable_shared_bucket_access] reference).

== Reference

The reference to the configuration properties can be found below.

* link:config-properties.html#databases-foo_db-enable_shared_bucket_access[$dbname.enable_shared_bucket_access] to enable convergence for a given database.
* link:config-properties.html#databases-foo_db-import_docs[$dbname.import_docs] to give a particular Sync Gateway node the role of importing the documents.
* link:config-properties.html#databases-foo_db-import_filter[$dbname.import_filter] to select which document(s) to make aware to mobile clients.

== FAQ

=== How do I query the document's sync metadata?

Starting in Couchbase Server 5.5, the N1QL query language supports the ability to select extended attributes (xattrs) where the document's sync metadata is stored.
The following query shows an example of that feature.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT meta().xattrs._sync FROM `travel-sample` WHERE meta().id = "mydocId"
----

Prior to 5.5, there is no way to query the mobile metadata with `shared_bucket_access_enabled: true`.

WARNING: The sync metadata is maintained internally by Sync Gateway and its structure can change at any time.
It should not be used to drive business logic of applications. The direct use of the N1QL query is *unsupported* and must not be used in production environments.

=== How do I access a blob stored in Couchbase Lite?

See the Couchbase Lite documentation on Blobs.

:param-bookmark: blobs
include::partial$blocklinks-cbl.adoc[]

=== How do I access an attachment from a WebApp?

Attachments can be accessed through Sync Gateway's REST API using the xref:rest-api.adoc#/attachment/get\__db___doc___attachment_[+/{db}/{doc}/{attachment}+] endpoint.

== Migrating from Bucket Shadowing

As of Sync Gateway 1.5, the Bucket Shadowing feature is deprecated and no longer supported.
The following steps outline a recommended method for migrating from Bucket Shadowing to the latest version with interoperability between Couchbase Server SDKs and Couchbase Mobile.

. Follow the recommendations in the xref:server:install:upgrade-online.adoc[Couchbase Server documentation] to upgrade all instances to 5.0.
. Create a new bucket on Couchbase Server (*bucket 2*).
. Install Sync Gateway 1.5 on a separate node with shared access enabled and connect it to the new bucket (*bucket 2*).
. Setup a link:running-replications.html[push replication] from the Sync Gateway instance used for Bucket Shadowing to the Sync Gateway 1.5 instance.
. Once the replication has completed, test your application is performing as expected.
. Update the load balancer to direct incoming traffic to the Sync Gateway 1.5 instance when you are ready to upgrade.
. Delete the first bucket (*bucket 1*).
