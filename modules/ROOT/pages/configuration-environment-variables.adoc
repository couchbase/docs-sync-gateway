== Introduction
include::partial$feature-catalog.adoc[tags=config-env-vars-def]

The use of environment variables within the configuration file increases the flexibility of the configuration process.
It makes the switching of the runtime behavior -- for example during development, experimentation or testing -- much easier.


== Syntax
To use an environment variable, simply insert its name as a token using `$var` or `${var}` where you would normally put the configuration value you are substituting for.

You can define inline default values using the notation +
`${var:-default}`.
The default value is used if the referenced environment variable is empty or undefined.

If you need to include a configuration file value that contains a literal `$` symbol, you must use `{double-dollar}` instead.
This enables the parser to differentiate between a literal `$` and the start of a variable name; so `pa{double-dollar}{double-dollar}` resolves to the value `pa{double-dollar}`.

    "db1": {
      "bucket": "bucket1",
      "server": "couchbase://localhost",
      "username": "$USERNAME", // <.>
      "password": "$PASSWORD"
    }
    "db2": {
      "bucket": "${var_bucket:-this_bucket}", // <.>
      "server": "couchbase://localhost",
      "username": "$USERNAME",
      "password": "pa{double-dollar}{double-dollar}word" // <.>
    }
  }
}

----

<.> Here we provide a reference to the environment variables `$USERNAME` footnote:[On Windows systems USERNAME is already in use as a System Variable used by the operating system] and `$PASSWORD`.
The values of those variable are substituted here immediately prior to the parsing of the configuration file.

<.> The variable `var_bucket` is given a default value of 'this_bucket', which is used only if the `var_bucket` environment variable itself is empty or undefined.

<.> This password value contains dollar symbols, so we need to use the `{double-dollar}` notation.
The value is interpreted as `pa{double-dollar}word`.

====


== Usage

Each variable is replaced immediately prior to the parsing of the configuration file at each Sync Gateway startup.

The variables are immutable.
This means changes to the values of the environment variables are not detected by Sync Gateway whilst it is running.
Such changes only become effective after a restart of Sync Gateway.

All environment variable names are case-sensitive in this context.
So `$username` and `$USERNAME` are not the same variable

Any references to undefined variables are replaced by an empty string.
This can result in an invalid configuration, which will cause the start-up to abandoned and an error reported.


== Variable Definition

How you define the environment variables will depend on the platform used to host Sync Gateway.

[{tabs}]
=====
Linux or Mac OS Terminal::
+
--
[{snippet-header}]
----
export USERNAME=Administrator
export PASSWORD=pa$$word
----
--

Windows CLI::
+
--
[source, dos, subs="+attributes, +macros"]
----
setx USERNAME Administrator // <.>
set PASSWORD=pa$$word // <.>
----
<.> Permanently set the `USERNAME` variable.
Note `setx` does not require the `=` symbol
<.> Sets the `PASSWORD` variable, but only for the duration of the current 'Command Line' session.
This may not be what you want.

--

Windows System Properties::
+
--
. Open a _System Properties_ panel
. On the _Advanced System Settings_ tab, select btn:[Environment Variables] +
This displays the _Environment Variables_ panel
. Here you can create btn:[NEW] variables as well as btn:[EDIT] and btn:[DELETE] existing variables

--

Powershell::
+
--
[source, powershell, subs="+attributes, +macros"]
----
$ENV:USERNAME=Administrator
$ENV:PASSWORD=pa{double-dollar}word
