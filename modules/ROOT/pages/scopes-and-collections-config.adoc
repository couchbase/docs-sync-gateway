:description: pass:q[Configure Scopes and Collections for Sync Gateway - Examples with descriptions.]

This section explains how to configure Scopes and Collections for Sync Gateway. 
It describes configuration options and provides example configuration code.

== Understanding Buckets, Scopes, and Collections
You can define 1 custom scope per database with up to 1000 custom collections. If you donâ€™t specify a custom scope and collection, any documents you create will be saved in the default scope and collection. For more information, examples and use cases, see https://www.couchbase.com/blog/scopes-collections-couchbase-mobile/[Scopes and Collections Support in Couchbase Mobile for Edge Applications].

== Configuration Options

When upgrading to Sync Gateway 3.1, it's not necessary to include `scopes` and `collections` in the configuration. 
If you choose not to specify them, your previous data set will still be compatible. 
Keep in mind that the provided examples are optional.

You have these options to configure Scopes and Collections Sync for Gateway:

* *custom scope/custom collection (the option we cover here)* +
You can define 1 custom scope per database with up to 1000 custom collections.
+
If you don't specify a custom scope and collection, any documents you create will be saved in the default scope and collection.

* *default scope/custom collection* +
You can choose the default scope with up to 1000 custom collections.
+
If you don't specify a custom scope and collection, any documents you create will be saved in the default scope and collection.

* *default scope/default collection* +
You can choose the default scope with default collection.
+
If you don't specify a custom scope and collection, any documents you create will be saved in the default scope and collection.
+

When you import a dataset created in previous versions of Couchbase Server, the documents will automatically be saved in the `_default` scope and `_default` collection.

== Configuration Example: custom scope/custom collection

This example covers a configuration with 1 custom Scope and 2 custom Collections:

| Field                 | Description

| name                  | The name of the database.
| bucket                | The name of the bucket associated with the database.
| scopes                | An object representing different scopes within the database. Each scope contains collections with their respective sync and import filter functions.
|                       |
| scope1                | The name of the first scope in the database.
| collections           | An object representing collections within the `scope1` scope. Each collection has its sync and import filter functions.
|                       |
| collection1           | The name of the first collection within `scope1`.
| sync                  | The sync function associated with `collection1`. This function is triggered when a document is created or updated in the collection. This code example illustrates a specific use case for sync functions. 
For more information, see xref:sync-function.adoc[Sync Functions].
|                       | The sync function checks if the `type` field of the document is not `default`. If it's not, it throws a `forbidden` error, rejecting the document.
|                       | After the rejection, it sends a message to the `legacy` channel.
| import_filter         | The import filter function associated with `collection1`. This function is used when importing documents into the collection. 
For more information, see xref:import-filter.adoc[Import Filters].
|                       | The import filter checks if the `type` field of the document is `mobile`. If it is, the document will be imported; otherwise, it will be skipped.
|                       |
| collection2           | The name of the second collection within `scope1`.
| sync                  | The sync function associated with `collection2`. This function is triggered when a document is created or updated in the collection. 
For more information, see xref:sync-function.adoc[Sync Functions].
|                       | The sync function sends a message to the `collection1` channel.
| import_filter         | The import filter function associated with `collection2`. This function is used when importing documents into the collection. 
For more information, see xref:import-filter.adoc[Import Filters].
|                       | The import filter checks if the `type` field of the document is `mobile`. If it is, the document will be imported; otherwise, it will be skipped.
|                       |
| num_index_replicas    | The number of index replicas. In this case, it is set to 0, meaning no replicas of indexes will be created for this database.

== Configuration Example: Dynamic Access Grant

[source,javascript]
----
function(doc, oldDoc, meta) {
   if (doc.userId) {
       channelId = "channel.profile:"+ doc.userId;
       // Assign document to channel
       channel(channelId);
       // Grant user access to channel
       access(doc.userId, channelId);
   }
   if (doc.providerId) {
       // Grant provider user access to channel
       access(doc.providerId, channelId);
   }
}
----

|===
| Field           | Explanation

| doc             | The `doc` object contains the data for the current document being processed.
| oldDoc          | The `oldDoc` object contains the previous version of the document (if available).
| meta            | The `meta` object contains metadata about the document, such as its expiration time.
| doc.userId      | Checks if the `doc` object contains a field called `userId`.
| channelId       | The string that represents the channel where the document is assigned.
| channel()       | A function used to assign the document to a channel represented by the `channelId`.
| access()        | A function used to grant access to a user for a specific channel.
| doc.providerId  | Checks if the `doc` object contains a field called `providerId`.

== Configuration Example: Custom Sync Function

[source,javascript]
----
function(doc, oldDoc, meta) {
   // Only users with provider role can update document
   requireRole("provider");
   if (doc.userId) {
       channelId = "channel.medication:"+ doc.userId;
       // Assign document to channel
       channel(channelId);
       // Grant user access to channel
       access(doc.userId, channelId);
     }
}
----

|===
| Field                                      | Explanation

| function                               | The function starts with `function(doc, oldDoc, meta)`. It takes three parameters: `doc`, `oldDoc`, and `meta`. These parameters represent the document being updated, the old version of the document, and metadata related to the update, respectively.
| requireRole                                 | The `requireRole("provider")` function checks whether the user performing the update has the "provider" role. If not, the update will not be allowed.
| if (doc.userId)                                 | A conditional check: `if (doc.userId)`. This checks whether the `doc` object has a property called `userId`. If this property exists, the following code will be executed.
| channelId                             | If the `doc.userId` property exists, the `channelId` variable is assigned a value in the format `"channel.medication:" + doc.userId`. This creates a unique channel ID based on the `userId` of the document.
| channel(channelId)                 | The `channel(channelId)` function is called, which associates the document with the channel specified by `channelId`. This is usually done in databases to organize and group documents based on certain criteria.
| access(doc.userId, channelId)                   | The `access(doc.userId, channelId)` function is called, which grants the user with `doc.userId` access to the channel identified by `channelId`. This access control mechanism ensures that only authorized users can view or interact with the documents in the channel.
