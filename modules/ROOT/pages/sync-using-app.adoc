== Syncing with Couchbase Lite Apps

Couchbase Lite client applications use a Replicator process to synchronize their local database, through  a Sync Gateway database, to a remote Couchbase Server database (server- or cloud-based) -- see: <<fig-sync-diag>>.

Pull Replication::
This is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite download database changes from the remote (server) source database to the local target database

Push Replication::
This is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite upload database changes from the local source database to the remote (server) target database

For more on how to build Couchbase Lite applications that use Sync Gateway replication, see the documentation for the appropriate language:
