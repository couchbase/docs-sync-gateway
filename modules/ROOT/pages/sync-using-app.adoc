Couchbase Lite client applications use a Replication process to synchronize their local database, through  a Sync Gateway database, to a remote Couchbase Server database (server- or cloud-based).

* Pull Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite download database changes from the remote (server) source database to the local target database

* Push Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite upload database changes from the local source database to the remote (server) target database

For more on how to build applications using Sync Gateway replication see the Couchbase Lite documentation set for the appropriate language:
