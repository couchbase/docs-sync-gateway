== Overview


Sync Gateway provides a robust <<lbl-continuous-logging>>{fn-clog} solution that delivers flexibility in terms of how logs are generated and retained, whilst also maintaining the level of logging required by Couchbase Support for investigation of issues.
Its logs are written to <<log-file-outputs, separate log files>> filtered by log level, with each log level supporting individual retention policies.
You control what is logged using the {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref} {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging} properties
{fnref-legacy-pre-3-0}.

In addition to the log files, you can also independently configure and control <<lbl-console-logs>>, which is a convenient method of accessing diagnostic information during debugging scenarios.
With _console logging_, system administrators can easily fine-tune diagnostic output to suit specific debug scenarios.
All without interfering with the logging required by Couchbase Support for the investigation of issues.


== Configuration


You configure _continuous_ and _console_ logging requirements in the {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref} file, using the {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging} properties {fn-legacy-pre-3-0}  -- see: <<sample-log-cfg>>.

[#lbl-log-redaction]
== Log Redaction


All log outputs -- _console_ or _continuous_ -- can optionally be redacted, which will remove any user-data considered private.

You enable this feature by setting the {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging-redaction-level} property {fnref-legacy-pre-3-0}.


[#lbl-console-logs]
== Console Logging


*In this section*: <<lbl-log-levels>>  | <<lbl-log-api>> |  <<lbl-log-keys>>  | <<lbl-log-color>>  | <<lbl-log-redirect>>

TIP: By default only HTTP logging is enabled

Console logs are your go-to resource for diagnostic information.
You can easily fine-tune their diagnostic content to meet the needs of a particular debugging scenario, perhaps by increasing the verbosity and filtering out unnecessary log_keys to better focus on the problem area.

Changes to _console logging_ are independent of continuous logging, so you can, for example, tweak any of the following without compromising the core continuous logging streams:

* Increase the verbosity using <<lbl-log-levels>> to generate additional diagnostic information
* Focus on the area under investigation by enabling or disabling specific <<lbl-log-keys>>
* Enhance readability by setting a <<log-color,color>> for log output based on log level

[#lbl-log-api]
=== Admin REST API
You can define console log settings in the bootstrap configuration file, or more conveniently, you can use the Admin REST API's `_config` endpoint to set them -- see: <<eg-setloggingwithapi>>.

[#eg-setloggingwithapi]
.Setting log_level and log_keys with API
====
[source, console]
----

curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:4985/_config' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "console": {

        "log_level": "trace", // <.>
        "log_keys": "[\"WS\",\"WSFrame\",\"Replicate\"]",  // <.>

    }
  }'


----
<.> Here we define the _log_level_ to be `trace` for maximum verbosity
<.> Here we specify the particular _log_keys_ we want to focus on. +
Note here we have chosen to exclude `http`; perhaps we want to focus on a websocket or replication issue.

The console log will show the following after this command:

[#lbl-log-levels]
=== Log Levels
TIP: When debugging, setting the _console log's_ log-level to `debug` or `trace` can provide valuable additional information

Console logs have six levels of verbosity -- see: <<tbl-loglevels>>.
The default  _log level_ is *`none`*

Note that the log levels are inclusive, so if you enable `info` level, then `warn` and `error` logs are also enabled.

You can define console log levels in the configuration file -- see {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging-console-log-level} {fnref-legacy-pre-3-0} and by using the Admin REST API (see: <<eg-setloggingwithapi>>).

One approach might be to set your base level in the configuration file and then use the Admin REST API for specific debugging scenarios.

|`[DBG]`

|`trace`
|`[TRC]`
|Displays extremely verbose output that might be useful when debugging
|===

[#lbl-log-keys]
=== Log Keys
TIP: Select log keys relevant to the area you are debugging, providing them as a comma-delimited list, such as: `"log_keys": ["HTTP", "CRUD", "Import"]` in the config or see <<eg-setloggingwithapi>> for how to provide them using the Admin REST API.

Log keys provide fine-grained control over the information types that Sync Gateway outputs to the console log.
By default, only *`HTTP`* related information is enabled, but a range of other keys are available to meet specific diagnostic needs -- see: <<tbl-logkeylist>>.

You can define the required {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging-console-log-keys} within your configuration file and-or use the Admin REST API (see: <<eg-setloggingwithapi>>).

[#lbl-log-color]
=== Set Log Color

To use color for log output based on log level, set  {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging-console-color-enabled} to `true`

NOTE: This setting is always disabled on Windows for compatibility reasons.

[#lbl-log-redirect]
=== Redirect Console Log
You can easily redirect the console log output to a file.
This can be useful not only for diagnostic sessions, but also when you have specialized logging requirements, such as centralized logging.
Just redirect the output and then apply your own log collection mechanism to feed that data elsewhere -- see <<eg-console-log-redirect>>.

[#eg-console-log-redirect]
.Console Log Redirection
====
[source, console]
----
# Start Sync Gateway and redirect console output to a file
./sync-gateway > my_sg_logs.txt 2>&1

# Start log collection to send to a centralized log aggregator.
logcollector my_sg_logs.txt

[#lbl-continuous-logging]
== Continuous Logging


*In this section*: <<lbl-logoutputs>>  |  <<lbl-logrotate>>

_Continuous logging_ produces a set of log files aimed primarily at providing appropriate diagnostic information for the Couchbase Support team should their intervention be required.
You define continuous logging settings in the configuration file -- see: <<sample-log-cfg>>.

With continuous logging the logs for each level are written to <<lbl-logoutputs, separate log files>> -- see: <<tbl-contlogoutputs>>.
You can set individual retention policies for each log-level.

[#lbl-logoutputs]
=== Log File Outputs
The log files output from continuous logging are intended *solely* for the use of _Couchbase Support_.

TIP: If you require special log handling, for example for centralized logging, then use the <<lbl-log-redirect>> feature to create a log file for this purpose from the console output stream.

Sync Gateway produces four separate log files, split by log level.
Each log file has its own guaranteed retention period - as shown in <<tbl-contlogoutputs>>

You can collect the log files, for analysis by Couchbase Support when diagnosing Sync Gateway issues, using {sgcollect-info--xref}.

.Continuos Logging - Log File Outputs
[#tbl-contlogoutputs,cols="^1,4,2,^1,^1,^1"]

h|Log File
h|Level
h|Description
h|Default enabled
h|Default max_age

|3 Days

|DEBUG

|`sg_debug.log`
|`false`
|2 Days
|1 Day
|===

TIP: Each log level and its parameters are defined using the {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging-console-log-level} property.

[#lbl-logrotate]
=== Log File Rotation

Log files are _rotated_ when they exceed a threshold `max_size` (megabytes).
Once rotated, they are compressed (gzip) to reduce the disk usage.

Aged logs are cleaned up once their age exceeds `max_age` days -- see: <<tbl-contlogoutputs>>

Configure log rotation using the {bootstrap-schema--xref--logging-console-rotation} property.

For pre-2.1 log rotation -- see: {legacy-logging-pre2-1--xref}
