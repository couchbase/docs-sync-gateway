= SG Collect Info

`sgcollect_info` is command line utility that provides detailed statistics for a specific Sync Gateway node.
This tool must be run on each node individually, not on all simultaneously.

`sgcollect_info` outputs the following statistics in a zip file:

. Logs
. Configuration
. Expvars (exported variables) that contain important stats
. System Level OS stats
. Golang profile output (runtime memory and cpu profiling info)

== CLI command and parameters

To see the CLI command line parameters, run:

[source,bash]
----
./sgcollect_info --help
----

== Examples

Collect Sync Gateway diagnostics and save locally:

[source,bash]
----
./sgcollect_info /tmp/sgcollect_info.zip
----

Collect Sync Gateway diagnostics and upload them to the Couchbase Support AWS S3 bucket:

[source,bash]
----
./sgcollect_info \
  --sync-gateway-config=/path/to/config.json \
  --sync-gateway-executable=/usr/bin/sync_gateway \
  --upload-host=s3.amazonaws.com/cb-customers \
  --customer=Acme \
  --ticket=123
  /tmp/sgcollect_info.zip

== REST Endpoint

`sgcollect_info` can now be run from the Admin REST API as of Sync Gateway 2.1 using the xref:admin-rest-api.adoc#/server/post\__sgcollect_info[_sgcollect_info] endpoint.

== Zipfile contents

The tool creates the following log files in the ouput file.

|System level logs like /var/log/dmesg on Linux

|`sync_gateway`
|The Sync Gateway binary executable

|`pprof_http_*.log`

== Installing Optional Dependencies

`sgcollect_info` will be able to collect more information if the following tools are installed:

* https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang] -- this should be the same version that Sync Gateway was built with.

[cols="1,1",width="50%"]
|===
|Version |Go build version

|1.3.0
|1.5.3

|1.3.1
|1.6.3
|===

If go is not installed, `sgcollect_info` will print the following error message, you can ignore this message and there is no need to report it.

`Exception during compression: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified IMPORTANT:Compression using gozip failed. Falling back to python implementation. Please let us know about this and provide console output.`

* https://www.graphviz.org/Download..php[Graphviz] -- this is used to render PDFs of the https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/[go pprof] output.
