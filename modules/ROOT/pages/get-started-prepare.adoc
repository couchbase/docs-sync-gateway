== Couchbase Requirements

Before you can usefully use Sync Gateway, you will need an operational Couchbase Server installation. You should ensure that you are using compatible versions of Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway -- see: <<sgw-and-couchbase-server>>.

TIP: You can get Couchbase Server from our {url-downloads}[Downloads, window=_blank] page

You will then need to configure Couchbase Server by adding a Bucket and an RBAC User for Sync Gateway -- see: <<configure-server>>.

== Configure Server for Sync Gateway

=== STEP 1 -- Create a Bucket

We will use this bucket to test the deployment of Sync Gateway, later in the Getting Started section.

. Login to Couchbase Server's Admin Console
.. Go to `+http://localhost:8091+`
.. Enter your administrator credentials

. Within the Admin Console's toolbar,
.. Select the *Buckets* tab
.. btn:[Add Bucket] to continue
+
image::cb-create-bucket.png[]
.. In the pop-up window, enter *getting-started-bucket* for the *name* and click *Add Bucket*.
You can leave the other options to their defaults.
+

=== STEP 2 -- Create RBAC User

// tag::create-rbac-user[]

To connect to Couchbase Server, you must create an RBAC user.
These user credentials are used in a later section to start Sync Gateway.

. Open the *Security* tab and click the *Add User* button.
+

. Create the RBAC user with appropriate access roles.
+
The steps to do this are shown in <<rbac-roles>>. Note that they differ, depending on your Couchbase Server version.

=== STEP 3 -- Set-up Network Access

When installing Couchbase Server on the cloud, ensure that network permissions (or firewall settings) allow incoming connections to Couchbase Server ports.

include::partial$sgw-svr-ports.adoc[]

If this is not done, the Couchbase Server node can experience difficulty joining a cluster.

You can refer to the {xref--pfx-svr}install:install-ports.adoc[Couchbase Server Ports] guide to see the full list of available ports and their associated services.
