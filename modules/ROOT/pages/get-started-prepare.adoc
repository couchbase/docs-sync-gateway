== Introduction

:param-page: {page-relative-src-path}
include::partial$_get-started-topic-group.adoc[]

In this Getting Started topic we will discuss the prerequisites you need to have in  place before you begin installing the Sync Gateway package.

On completion of this page you should:

* Know whether your set-up meets the <<lbl-req-minim>> and <<lbl-req-compat>> for running Sync Gateway
* Know how to install and or <<configure-server>>
* Have a working Couchbase Server deployment configured for Sync Gateway, including an RBAC user, ready for Sync Gateway's use
* Have appropriate network credentials and <<lbl-set-netw-access, Network Access>>

Your next step will be covered in {get-started-install--xref}


[#lbl-req-minim, reftext=Minimum Requirements]
== Couchbase Requirements

Before you can usefully use Sync Gateway, you will need an operational Couchbase Server installation. You should ensure that you are using compatible versions of Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway -- see: <<lbl-req-compat>>.

TIP: You can get Couchbase Server from our {url-downloads}[Downloads, window=_blank] page

You will then need to configure Couchbase Server by adding a Bucket and an RBAC User for Sync Gateway -- see: <<configure-server>>.

[#configure-server]
== Configure Server for Sync Gateway

=== STEP 1 -- Create a Bucket

We will use this bucket to test the deployment of Sync Gateway, later in the Getting Started section.

. Login to Couchbase Server's Admin Console
.. Go to `+http://localhost:8091+`
.. Enter your administrator credentials

. Within the Admin Console's toolbar,
.. Select the *Buckets* tab
.. btn:[Add Bucket] to continue
+
image::cb-create-bucket.png[]
.. In the pop-up window, enter *get-started-bucket* for the *name* and click *Add Bucket*.
You can leave the other options to their defaults.
+
include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags="ephemeral-buckets"]

+
image::cb-create-bucket-popup.png[]


=== STEP 2 -- Create RBAC User

// tag::create-rbac-user[]

You will need to create at least one RBAC user in Couchbase Server as {sgw} requires RBAC user credentials to authenticate and authorize access not only to Couchbase Server buckets, but also to its Admin and Metrics API.
If you plan to use these API then you are advised to create at least one user  for each of:

* Couchbase Server Access +
Add an RBAC user that Sync Gateway uses to authenticate and authorize access to Couchbase Server.
Use the _sync_gateway_ role.
* Admin API +
Add an RBAC user that administrators can use to authenticate and authorize access to the {sgw} Admin REST API
Use the _Full Admin_ role.
* Metrics API +
Add an RBAC user that devops can use to authenticate and authorize access to the {sgw} Metrics REST API
Use the _Read-Only Admin_ or _Application Access_ roles.

Enterprise edition users can exert a finer-grained control using additional roles appropriate to the functionality required for the specific user.

For more on creating Couchbase Server users see: {server-manage-security-users-and-roles--xref}.

.How-to

. Within _Couchbase Server's Dashboard_, *Open* the *Security* tab and click the *Add User* button.
+
image::create-user.png[]

. Create the RBAC user with appropriate access roles, this will differ for each of the user types.
+
The steps to do this are shown in <<rbac-roles>>. Note that they differ, depending on your Couchbase Server version.

[#lbl-set-netw-access]
=== STEP 3 -- Set-up Network Access

When installing Couchbase Server on the cloud, ensure that network permissions (or firewall settings) allow incoming connections to Couchbase Server ports.

include::partial$sgw-svr-ports.adoc[]

If this is not done, the Couchbase Server node can experience difficulty joining a cluster.

You can refer to the {xref--pfx-svr}install:install-ports.adoc[Couchbase Server Ports] guide to see the full list of available ports and their associated services.
