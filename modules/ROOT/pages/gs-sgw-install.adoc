This content explains how to install a Sync Gateway instance

.Preparatory Steps
NOTE: Before starting ensure you have read and actioned the in steps in {xref-pfx}gs-sgw-prereqs.adoc[]

Install Sync Gateway on the operating system of your choice:

== Enterprise Edition

[{tabs}]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
Download Sync Gateway from the {url-downloads}#couchbase-mobile[Couchbase downloads page] or using `wget`.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
wget {sg_download_link}{sg_package_name_ee}.deb
----

Install sync_gateway with the dpkg package manager e.g:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
dpkg -i {sg_package_name_ee}.deb
----

When the installation is complete sync_gateway will be running as a service.

To stop/start the `sync_gateway` service, use the following.

[source,bash]
----
sudo service sync_gateway start
sudo service sync_gateway stop
----

The config file and logs are located in `/home/sync_gateway`.

You can also run the *sync_gateway* binary directly from the command line.
The binary is installed at `/opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway`.
--

Red Hat/CentOS::
+
--
Download Sync Gateway from the {url-downloads}#couchbase-mobile[Couchbase downloads page] or using the `wget`.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
wget {sg_download_link}{sg_package_name_ee}.rpm

----
. Launch the `sync_gateway` program from the command line.
+
[source,console]
----
~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway
----

*Option 2:* Run Sync Gateway as a service

. Unpack the tar.gz installer to the */opt* directory.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo tar -zxvf {sg_package_name_ee}.tar.gz --directory /opt
----
. Create a new macOS user.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo sysadminctl -addUser sync_gateway
----
If the operation is successful, you will get the following output.
+
[source,console]
----
sysadminctl ----------------------------
sysadminctl No clear text password or interactive option was specified (adduser, change/reset password will not allow user to use FDE) !
sysadminctl ----------------------------
sysadminctl Creating user record…
sysadminctl Assigning UID: 505
sysadminctl Creating home directory at /Users/sync_gateway
----
. Create a new group and add the `sync_gateway` user to that group.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo dseditgroup -o create sync_gateway
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a sync_gateway -t user sync_gateway
----
. Run Sync Gateway as a service with the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/service
sudo ./sync_gateway_service_install.sh
----
Other scripts in that directory are available to update or uninstall the service.
