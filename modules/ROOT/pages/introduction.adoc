You can read more about the Data Synchronization process in {xref-pfx}shared-bucket-access.adoc[Mobile-Server Data Synchronization].
Amongst its most important and commonly used features is secure **Access Control**.

Sync Gateway assures secure access control using:

* **User authentication**, which ensures that only authorized users can connect to Sync Gateway.
For more information see
{xref-pfx}users-and-roles.adoc[Users and Roles] and the  {xref-pfx}authentication.adoc[User Authentication Guide]
+
* *Data Routing*, which ensures that authorized users can only access documents in those {xref-pfx}sync-gateway-channels.adoc[Sync Gateway Channel(s)] assigned to them and only in accordance with their assigned privileges.
You can set those privileges to confer {xref-pfx}read-access.adoc[Read Access] and-or {xref-pfx}write-access.adoc[Write Access] as required.
+
The business logic behind the validation and authorization of document access is provided by the customizable {xref-pfx}sync-function.adoc[Sync Function].
