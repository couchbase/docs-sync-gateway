= Introduction

Sync Gateway is the synchronization server in a Couchbase Mobile deployment.

Couchbase Mobile brings the power of NoSQL to the edge and is comprised of three components:

* xref:couchbase-lite::introduction.adoc[Couchbase Lite], an embedded, NoSQL JSON Document Style database for your mobile apps
* xref:sync-gateway::introduction.adoc[Sync Gateway], an internet-facing synchronization mechanism that securely syncs data between mobile clients and server, and
* xref:server:introduction:intro.adoc[Couchbase Server], a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database platform

The following diagram describes the architecture for a typical deployment comprised of Couchbase Lite, Couchbase Server SDKs, Sync Gateway, and Couchbase Server.

Sync Gateway is designed to provide data synchronization for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT applications.
Amongst its most important and commonly used features is secure **Access Control**.


Sync Gateway assures secure access control using:

* **User authentication**, which ensures that only authorized users can connect to Sync Gateway.
+
See:
xref:users-and-roles.adoc[Users and Roles] |
xref:authentication.adoc[User Authentication Guide]
+
* *Data Routing*
+
This ensures that authorized users can only access documents in those xref:sync-gateway-channels.adoc[Sync Gateway Channel(s)] assigned to them and only in accordance with their assigned privileges.
You can set those privileges to confer xref:read-access.adoc[Read Access] and-or xref:write-access.adoc[Write Access] as required.
+
The business logic behind the validation and authorization of document access is provided by the customizable xref:sync-function.adoc[Sync Function].
