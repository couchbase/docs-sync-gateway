= Introduction

Sync Gateway is the synchronization server in a Couchbase Mobile deployment.

Couchbase Mobile brings the power of NoSQL to the edge and is comprised of three components:

* xref:couchbase-lite::introduction.adoc[Couchbase Lite], an embedded, NoSQL JSON Document Style database for your mobile apps
* xref:sync-gateway::introduction.adoc[Sync Gateway], an internet-facing synchronization mechanism that securely syncs data between mobile clients and server, and
* xref:server:introduction:intro.adoc[Couchbase Server], a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database platform

The following diagram describes the architecture for a typical deployment comprised of Couchbase Lite, Couchbase Server SDKs, Sync Gateway, and Couchbase Server.

Sync Gateway is designed to provide configurable, secure and scalable data synchronization for large-scale interactive applications (web, mobile, and IoT).
It does this using features such as:

* *User authentication* -- which ensures that only authorized and authenticated users can connect to Sync Gateway (see xref:authentication.adoc[user authentication guide]) and that, once connected, they can only use it in the proscribed manner.
* *Access control* -- that determines which authenticated users see which set of data. It uses _access channels_ and business logic to ensure that documents only synchronize with assigned channels and, similarly, that (authenticated) users also can only access assigned channels. The logic behind this processing is delivered by Sync Gateway's xref:sync-function.adoc[Sync Function].
