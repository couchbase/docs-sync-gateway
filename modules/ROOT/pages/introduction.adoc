You can read more about the Data Synchronization process in {xref-sgw-pg-shared-bucket-access}.
Amongst its most important and commonly used features is secure **Access Control**.

Sync Gateway assures secure access control using:

* **User authentication**, which ensures that only authorized users can connect to Sync Gateway.
For more information see the
{xref-sgw-pg-users} and {authentication-users--xref} content.
+
* *Data Routing*, which ensures that authorized users can only access documents in those {xref-sgw-pg-channels} assigned to them and only in accordance with their assigned privileges.
You can set those privileges to confer {xref-sgw-pg-read-access} and-or {xref-sgw-pg-write-access} as required.
+
The business logic behind the validation and authorization of document access is provided by the customizable {xref-sgw-pg-adv-sgw-cfg-sync-function}.
