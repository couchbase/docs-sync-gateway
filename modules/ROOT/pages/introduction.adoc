This topic is the first step of Sync Gateway's Getting Started topic group.

// tag::intro[]
Sync Gateway is the synchronization server in a Couchbase for Mobile and Edge deployment.
It is designed to provide data synchronization for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT applications

As you can see from <<fig-mobile-server>> Sync Gateway synchronizes changes made by web clients through its REST API, Couchbase Lite mobile-device applications, and Couchbase Server buckets.

You can read more about the Data Synchronization process in {sync-with-couchbase-server--xref}.
Some of its most central, and commonly used features, are those used to ensure secure **Access Control**.

Sync Gateway assures secure access control using:

* **User authentication**, which ensures that only authorized users can connect to Sync Gateway.
For more information see the
{users--xref}, {roles--xref} and {authentication-users--xref} content.

* *Data Routing*, which ensures that authorized users can only access documents in those {channels--xref} assigned to them and only in accordance with their assigned privileges.
You can set those privileges to confer {read-access--xref} and-or {write-access--xref} as required.

The business logic behind the validation and authorization of document access is provided by the customizable {sync-function--xref}.
