== Introduction

include::page$learn/icr-sgreplicate.adoc[tags=intro]


// // tag::overview[]
// Couchbase Sync Gateway supports _{glos-term-inter-sync-gateway-replication}_, {fn-icr} an increasingly important enterprise-level requirement that
// supports _{glos-term-cloud-to-edge} synchronization_ use cases, where data changes must be synchronized between a centralized cloud cluster and a large number of edge clusters whilst still enforcing fine grained access control.

// In the architecture diagram (<<icr-architecture>>), any database changes made on either Sync Gateway instance are replicated to the other Sync Gateway instance, in accordance with the replication's configuration -- see {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-replications} for configuration details.

== Replication Characteristics
_In this section_:  <<context>>  |  <<protocol>>  |  <<types-of-replication>>  |  <<delta-sync>>  |  <<directionality>>  |  <<security>>
// In _SGR-2_ one Sync Gateway node acts as the _{glos-term-active-replicator}_ in the replication process between local and remote Sync Gateway nodes.
// This provides the ability to run replications between:

// * Sync Gateway clusters - see <<icr-cloud-to-edge>>
// * Active mobile clusters - see <<icr-active-mobile>>

=== Context
Sync Gateway supports the ability to run replications between Sync Gateway clusters using Inter-sync-gateway Replication (v2), with the {glos-term-active-replicator} {glos-term-synchronizing} changes between two {glos-term-sync-gateway-databases}.

Replications always involve at least one local database.
Sync Gateway does not enable replication between two _remote_ nodes, because replications are defined at database level and so at least one database will be local.

Sync Gateway nodes can opt-out of participating in the replication process using the database-level parameter {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-databases-sgr-enabled}.

_Related configuration elements_:  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-databases}  |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-replications}  |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-remote} |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-databases-sgr-enabled}

=== Protocol

Inter-sync-gateway Replication (v2), are websocket-based.

The bi-directional, persistent, nature of websocket connections is ideal for applications such as a _continuous_ Sync Gateway replication, which is constantly waiting-for and synchronizing change events.

// === General Characteristics

=== Types of Replication
All replications take place at the document level.

Replications are either: {glos-term-adhoc-replication} (REST API only) or {glos-term-persistent-replication}.
They can also be configured to run in one of two-modes:
{glos-term-continuous} or {glos-term-oneshot}.

_Related configuration elements_:  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-replications}  |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-continuous} |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-adhoc}

=== Delta Sync
NOTE: Delta-sync is available only with the {enterprise}.

With delta-sync enabled on the replication and both database involved, only the changed data items are transferred.

You can configure replications to use delta-sync by:

* Setting `"enable_delta_sync": true` in the _replication definition_
* Setting `"delta-sync": { "enabled": true}` on both databases in their respective _database definitions_.

_Related configuration elements_:  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-databases}  |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-replications}  |
{xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-databases-delta-sync}  |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-delta}

=== Directionality

Replications are bi-directional.
You can push, pull or pushandpull between the two database endpoints.

_Related configuration elements_:  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-replications}  |  {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-direction}


=== Security

==== Authentication

SG-Replicate supports basic authentication using user name and password credentials.

==== Access Control

Sync Gateway ensures effective and consistent access control by passing all document changes through the databases' _{glos-term-sync-function}_.

_Related how-to_: {xref-sgw-pg-def-sync-function}  |  {xref-sgw-pg-adv-sgw-cfg-sync-function}


== Network Resilience

Persistent inter-sync-gateway replications will automatically attempt to restart whenever the node does.

Network resiliency is built-in for _continuous_ replications.
They respond to network issues such as lost connections, by applying a {glos-term-persistent-exponential-backoff} policy to attempt reconnection.

The {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-backoff} determines the maximum wait time between retries.
When the limit is reached retries are made every `max_backoff_time` minutes.
Set `"max_backoff_time": 0` to prevent indefinite retries. Exponential backoff retries will be attempted for up to 5 minutes and then stop if the connection has not been re-established

[NOTE]
.AD HOC Replications
====
No automatic reconnection attempts are made following network failures for ad hoc replications. +
The controlling user or application should apply the appropriate corrective action.

== High Availability

include::partial$incpg-icr-availability.adoc[leveloffset=+1]



// === High-availability replication

// include::page${sgw-pg-icr-high-availability}[tag=overview]

// See: /parameter definition/  |  {xref-sgw-pg-icr-high-availability-node-dist}

// === Network Resilience

// Network resiliency is built-in for _continuous_ replications, which will restart automatically whenever the node does and will retry lost connections.

// When a node fails due to network issues, SGR-2 applies a persistent exponential backoff policy to attempt reconnection  (see max_backoff_time).
// Retries can be configured to stop after a defined period of time.

// NOTE: SGR-2 will not attempt reconnection following network failures for ad hoc replications. The controlling user or application should apply the appropriate corrective action.

// == Replication Types

// Sync Gateway supports two replication types

// Persistent::
// +
// --
// Persistent replications survive Sync Gateway node restarts.
// They are initialized by configuring them in the _sync-gateway-config.json file_.

//  SGR2 Only You can also create persistent replications by using the {xref-sgw-pg-rest-api-admin}.
// --

// Ad hoc::
// +
// --
// Ad hoc replications are transient, existing only for the period of the replication. They are initialized and run using {xref-sgw-pg-rest-api-admin} requests.

// Once created they start in the 'running' state. When they enter 'stopped', or 'error', state they are automatically removed.

// Ad hoc replications provide a convenient way to:

// * Run one off replications (for example, when troubleshooting)
// * Run on-demand replications after Sync Gateway is started.
// For instance a replication that needs to be to be run only periodically can be configured as an ad hoc replication by an automated script scheduled to run when needed.
// --

// Alternative Methods::
// +
// --
// xref:server:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[XDCR] (cross data centre replication) is the Couchbase Server API to replicate between Couchbase Server clusters.

// Both XDCR and SG Replicate 2.0 can be used to keep clusters in different data centres in sync.
// However, SG Replicate 2.0 was designed specifically for Couchbase Mobile deployments and must be used for replication between mobile clusters.
// --

// == Constraints

// Inter-sync-gateway Replication (v2) will only replicate Sync Gateway databases hosted on versions of Sync Gateway later than March 7, 2014.


== Conflict Resolution

include::partial$incpg-icr-conflict.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// SGR-2 replications incorporate automatic conflict resolution.

// You can opt to resolve conflicts by applying:

// * SGR-2's default automatic strategy
// * One of the built-in resolution strategies
// * A a customized strategy of the your own design.

// See: {xref-sgw-pg-icr-conflict-resolution-auto}

// /parameter definition/  |  /more information/

== Initialization
// As covered in {xref-sgw-pg-icr-sgreplicate-init}, replications are defined by a {glos-term-replication-definition} in either:

// * Sync Gateway's configuration file +
// For persistent replications, whether continuous or one-shot.
// * The Admin REST API for either:
// ** Persistent replications, whether continuous or one-shot
// ** _Ad hoc_ replications (one-shot only).


// -- see: <<running-configured-replications>>
// -- see: <<running-rest-api-initialized-replications>>

include::partial$incpg-icr-initialization.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


// === Replication Definitions

// All replications are 'initialized' by a {glos-term-replication-definition} in the configuration file or Admin REST API.
// For SGR-2, _replication definitions_ are at database level -- see: <<replication-definition-elements>>.

// // include::partial$icr-repl-props-table-sgr2.adoc[]

// === Running Replications

// Sync Gateway nodes can be configured to opt-out of replication.

// Running replications are distributed uniformly across all available nodes.

// include::page${sgw-pg-icr-running}[tag=overview]

// See: {xref-sgw-pg-icr-running-getrepdtls}

== Replication Administration

== Monitoring Replications

include::partial$incpg-icr-monitoring.adoc[leveloffset=+1, tags=!overview]


Unsupported::
`InsecureSkipVerify` can be used to configure Sync Gateway to skip validation of TLS certs used for SG-Replication.
Not for use in production environments. Due to its unsupported nature, there is no guarantee on it ongoing availability.

* {enterprise} SG-Replicate must support cert based authentication.
Note : Support for cert-based authentication is not a P0 for Hydrogen but will be a future consideration
