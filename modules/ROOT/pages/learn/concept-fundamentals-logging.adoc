== Log Levels

Sync Gateway logs at one (or more) of six defined _log levels_: none; error; warn; info; debug and trace.

You can set individual retention policies for each <<log-levels, log level>>, with logs for each level being written to <<log-file-outputs, separate files>>.

Set log levels in your configuration file (see the xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-$level[`logging.$level`] reference).

NOTE: Log levels are additive, so if you enable `info` level, `warn` and `error` logs are also enabled.

The configurable log levels comprise (ordered from least verbose, to most):
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Log Level |Appearance |Description

|`none`
|          -
|Disables log output

|`error`
|`[ERR]`
|Displays errors that need urgent attention

|`warn`
|`[WRN]`
|Displays warnings that need some attention

|`info`
|`[INF]`
|Displays information about normal operations that don't need attention

|`debug`
|`[DBG]`
|Displays verbose output that might be useful when debugging

|`trace`
|`[TRC]`
|Displays extremely verbose output that might be useful when debugging
|===

== Log Keys

Log keys provide fine-grained control over the information to be logged.
By default, only `HTTP` is enabled, other available keys include: Auth; Bucket; CRUD; DCP and Import.

See the xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-console-log_keys[`logging.console.log_level`] property reference for a comprehensive list of available keys.

== Console Log Output

You can configure _console logging_ independently, providing additional flexibility, without impacting the continuous logging output.
For example, System administrators running Sync Gateway at the console may:

* tweak log level and <<log-keys>> to suit their needs,
* filter console output by log levels and log keys
* set a color for log output based on log level if xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-console-color_enabled[`logging.console.color_enabled`] is set to `true`
+
NOTE: This setting is always disabled on Windows for compatibility reasons.

== Log File Outputs

NOTE: Log files are intended for the use of _Couchbase Support_. If you require special log handling then use the <<output-log-redirection, console log output stream>>.

Use xref:sgcollect-info.adoc[SGCollect Info] to collect diagnostic log data for analysis by Couchbase Support.

The log files are split by log level, with a guaranteed retention period for each.

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Log File |Default enabled |Default max_age |Minimum max_age

|`sg_error.log`
|`true`
|360 Days
|180 Days

|`sg_warn.log`
|`true`
|180 Days
|90 Days

|`sg_info.log`
|`true`
|6 Days
|3 Days

|`sg_debug.log`
|`false`
|2 Days
|1 Day
|===

TIP: Each log level and its parameters are described in the xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-$level[logging.$level] property reference.

== Output Redirection

Address specialized logging requirements, such as centralized logging, by redirecting the console log output to a file. Then you can apply your own log collection mechanism to feed that data elsewhere.

.Redirect console log output
====
[source]
----
# Start Sync Gateway and redirect console output to a file
./sync-gateway > my_sg_logs.txt 2>&1

# Start log collection to send to a centralized log aggregator.
logcollector my_sg_logs.txt
----
====

== Log File Rotation

Log files are _rotated_ once each exceeds a threshold `max_size` in megabytes.
Once rotated, the log files are compressed (gzip) to reduce the disk usage.
Aged logs are cleaned up once their age exceeds `max_age` days.

Configure log rotation using the xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-level-$rotation[logging.level.$rotation] property.

== Log Redaction

All log outputs can be redacted, removing any user-data considered private.
Enable this feature by setting the xref:config-properties.adoc#logging-redaction_level[`logging.redaction_level`] property.
