== Installation

Install Sync Gateway on the operating system of your choice:

[{tabs}]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
Download Sync Gateway from the {url-downloads}#couchbase-mobile[Couchbase downloads page] or using `wget`.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
wget {sg_download_link}{sg_package_name}.deb
----

Install sync_gateway with the dpkg package manager e.g:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
dpkg -i {sg_package_name}.deb
----

When the installation is complete sync_gateway will be running as a service.

To stop/start the `sync_gateway` service, use the following.

[source,bash]
----
sudo service sync_gateway start
sudo service sync_gateway stop
----

The config file and logs are located in `/home/sync_gateway`.

You can also run the *sync_gateway* binary directly from the command line.
The binary is installed at `/opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway`.
--

Red Hat/CentOS::
+
--
Download Sync Gateway from the {url-downloads}#couchbase-mobile[Couchbase downloads page] or using the `wget`.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]

If the installation was successful you will see the following.

image::windows-installation-complete.png[]

Sync Gateway runs as a service (reachable on `+http://localhost:4985+`). To stop/start the service, you can use the Services application (*Control Panel -> Admin Tools -> Services*).

* The configuration file is located under `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\serviceconfig.json`.
* Logs are located under `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\var\lib\couchbase\logs`.
--

macOS::
+
--
Download Sync Gateway from the {url-downloads}#couchbase-mobile[Couchbase downloads page] or using the `wget`.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
wget {sg_download_link}{sg_package_name}.tar.gz
----

From here, there are two installation options.

*Option 1:* Start Sync Gateway from the Command Line

. Unpack the tar.gz installer.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo tar -zxvf {sg_package_name}.tar.gz
----
. Launch the `sync_gateway` program from the command line.
+
[source,console]
----
~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway
----

*Option 2:* Run Sync Gateway as a service

. Unpack the tar.gz installer to the */opt* directory.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo tar -zxvf {sg_package_name}.tar.gz --directory /opt
----
. Create a new macOS user.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo sysadminctl -addUser sync_gateway
----
If the operation is successful, you will get the following output.
+
[source,console]
----
sysadminctl ----------------------------
sysadminctl No clear text password or interactive option was specified (adduser, change/reset password will not allow user to use FDE) !
sysadminctl ----------------------------
sysadminctl Creating user record…
sysadminctl Assigning UID: 505
sysadminctl Creating home directory at /Users/sync_gateway
----
. Create a new group and add the `sync_gateway` user to that group.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo dseditgroup -o create sync_gateway
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a sync_gateway -t user sync_gateway
----
. Run Sync Gateway as a service with the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/service
sudo ./sync_gateway_service_install.sh
----
Other scripts in that directory are available to update or uninstall the service.
. Sync Gateway is now reachable on http://0.0.0.0:4984[0.0.0.0:4984].
The configuration file and logs are located in `/Users/sync_gateway`.

The following sections describe how to install and configure Sync Gateway to run with Couchbase Server.

=== Network configuration

Sync Gateway uses specific ports for communication with the outside world, mostly Couchbase Lite databases replicating to and from Sync Gateway.
The following table lists the ports used for different types of Sync Gateway network communication:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Port |Description

|4984
|Public port.
External HTTP port used for replication with Couchbase Lite databases and other applications accessing the REST API on the Internet.

|4985
|Admin port.
Internal HTTP port for unrestricted access to the database and to run administrative tasks.
|===

== Configure Couchbase Server

To configure Couchbase Server before connecting Sync Gateway, run through the following.

{url-downloads}[Download] and install Couchbase Server.

=== Creating a bucket

. Open the Couchbase Server Admin Console on `+http://localhost:8091+` and log on using your administrator credentials.
. In the toolbar, select the *Buckets* tab and click the *Add Bucket* button.
+
image::cb-create-bucket.png[]

. Provide a bucket name, for example *staging*, and leave the other options to their defaults.

=== Creating an RBAC user

In order for Sync Gateway to connect to Couchbase Server, you must create an RBAC user.
The RBAC user credentials will be used in a later section to start Sync Gateway.

. Open the *Security* tab and click the *Add User* button.
+
image::create-user.png[]

. The steps to create the RBAC user differ slightly depending on the version of Couchbase Server that you have installed. We explain the differences below.
+
[{tabs}]
====
Couchbase Server 5.5 or above::
+
In the pop-up window, provide a *Username* and *Password*, those credentials will be used by Sync Gateway to connect later on.
Next, you must grant RBAC roles to that user.
If you are using Couchbase Server 5.5, you must enable the *Application Access* and *Read Only Admin* roles.
+
image::user-settings-5-5.png[]

Couchbase Server 5.1::
+
In the pop-up window, provide a *Username* and *Password*, those credentials will be used by Sync Gateway to connect later on.
Next, you must grant RBAC roles to that user.
If you are using Couchbase Server 5.1, you must enable the *Bucket Full Access* and *Read Only Admin* roles.
+
image::user-settings.png[]
====

=== Network access

If you're installing Couchbase Server on the cloud, make sure that network permissions (or firewall settings) allow incoming connections to Couchbase Server ports.
In a typical mobile deployment on premise or in the cloud (AWS, RedHat, etc.), the following ports must be opened on the host for Couchbase Server to operate correctly: 8091, 8092, 8093, 8094, 11207, 11210, 11211, 18091, 18092, 18093.
You must verify that any firewall configuration allows communication on the specified ports.
If this is not done, the Couchbase Server node can experience difficulty joining a cluster.
You can refer to the xref:server:install:install-ports.adoc[Couchbase Server Network Configuration] guide to see the full list of available ports and their associated services.

== Start Sync Gateway

The following steps explain how to connect Sync Gateway to the Couchbase Server instance that was configured in the previous section.

* Open a new file called *sync-gateway-config.json* with the following.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/getting-started/sync-gateway-config.json[]
----
+
This configuration contains the user credentials of the *sync_gateway* user you created previously.
It also enables xref:shared-bucket-access.adoc[shared bucket access]; this feature was introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5 to allow Couchbase Server SDKs to also perform operation on this bucket.

* Start Sync Gateway from the command line, or if Sync Gateway is running in a service replace the configuration file and restart the service.
+
[source,bash]
----
~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway ~/path/to/sync-gateway-config.json
----

* Run the application where Couchbase Lite is installed.

* To verify that documents have been replicated, you can:
** Monitor the Sync Gateway sequence number returned by the database endpoint (xref:sync-gateway::rest-api.adoc#/database/get\__db__[`+GET /{db}/+`]).
The sequence number increments for every change that happens on the Sync Gateway database.
** Query a document by ID on the Sync Gateway REST API (xref:sync-gateway::rest-api.adoc#/document/get\__db___doc_[`+GET /{db}/{id}+`]).
** Query a document from the Query Workbench on the Couchbase Server Console.
