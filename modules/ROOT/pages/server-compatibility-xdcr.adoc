== Introduction

Couchbase Server provides the backing data store for Sync Gateway and it is compatible -- see: {compatibility--xref}.
However, there are considerations you needs to be aware of when using some Couchbase Server features with Sync Gateway.

One of those instances concerns the use of Couchbase Mobile and {server-xdcr--xref} (XDCR), which use different replication technologies.
Here we show how you can combine the two, maximizing the strengths of both, whist minimizing any functional or performance impact.


[#lbl-isgr]
== Inter Sync Gateway Replication

If you need to sync mobile clusters, you should use Inter-Sync Gateway replication -- see: {sync-inter-syncgateway-overview--xref}.
It was designed to keep mobile clusters in different data centers in sync.
The ideal use-case being the need to replicate edge clusters containing active Sync{nbsp}Gateway nodes between geographically separate cloud-based Sync Gateway deployments.
A typical architecture for this use case is shown in <<icr-active-mobile>>.

Inter-Sync Gateway replication provides bi-directional read/write replications that ensure:

* Cluster specific security is observed; by invoking the appropriate Sync Function.
* The integrity of security history is maintained.
Historical access rules are held and maintained in the Sync Gateway metadata.
This history is necessary to consistently handle the revocation of access grants.
* A consistent Revision Id is used across all clusters, allowing clients to identify a revision regardless of the cluster it is on.
* Cluster-specific _sync documents are not replicated to other mobile clusters

[#lbl-xdcr]
== Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)

Like inter-Sync Gateway Replication, Couchbase Server's Cross Data Center Replication (xref:server:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[XDCR]) can be used to replicate between Couchbase Mobile clusters.
XDCR replicates all of Sync Gatewayâ€™s metadata (_sync xattr) along with associated documents.

Your default preference for the replication of Couchbase Mobile changes should always be to use inter-Sync{nbsp}Gateway replication.

XDCR can be useful though in use-cases where the entire dataset from a source bucket is replicated to a target bucket. This could include categories such as active standby, disaster recovery, data migration and _lift-and-shift_ cases in hybrid cloud.

In all these categories you should run XDCR in unidirectional mode, deploying Sync Gateway only at one end of the XDCR-replicated bucket (source, or target) -- see: <<ex-xdcr-data-repl>>.

.XDCR Replication
====
In this example XDCR deployment:

* XDCR is run unidirectionally.
It pushes data from the primary data center to the secondary data centers, where it is pulled by Sync Gateway for downstream clients.
* Sync Gateway, although deployed at both ends of the XDCR replication, crucially is in *read-only* mode at the target end.

[#lbl-prov-drc]
== Disaster Recovery Scenario

In a Disaster Recovery scenario XDCR serves an important role in setting-up target mobile clusters.

Here XDCR supports Disaster Recovery and Data Migration.
Even though Sync Gateway is the operational replicator of choice for mobile data, it is only ever deployed at one end of the unidirectional XDCR replication.
