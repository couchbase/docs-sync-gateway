== Prometheus format

Like other Couchbase services, Sync Gateway offers Prometheus-compatible metrics in a flat JSON format.

Use the `_metrics` method to request these metrics:

[#ex-metprom]
.Metrics in Prometheus format
====
[source,console]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4986/_metrics" -H "accept: application/json"
----
====

This endpoint's data will be scraped at configurable interval, when the `metricsInterface` is activated and Sync Gateway integrated with Prometheus -- see: xref:stats-prometheus.adoc[] and our blog entry {url-blog-prometheus}.

The response in Prometheus format is defined as follows:

[template,attachment$metrics_metadata.json]
--
include::partial$metrics.hbs[]
