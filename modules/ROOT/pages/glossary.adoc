No conflicts mode::

Optional feature in xref:couchbase-lite::swift.adoc#handling-conflicts[Couchbase Lite 2.0 and above] and xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-allow_conflicts[Sync Gateway 2.0 and above].

Tombstone revision::
A document revision that contains only the document ID, a revision ID and the `_deleted: true` key value pair.
A tombstone revision acts as the record of a deleted item.
Tombstone revisions are created to allow all devices to see that a document has been deleted - particularly in the case of devices that may not be online continuously and therefore not syncing regularly.
