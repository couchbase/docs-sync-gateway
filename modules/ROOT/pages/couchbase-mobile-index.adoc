Couchbase Mobile raises events when data changes in the database.
These events can be subscribed to on both the device and server

// [.pane__frame--pink.cols-3]
=== Rest API
image::icons/restapi.png[,25,float="right",align="center"]
REST APIs provide full programmatic access for reading and writing data over the web.
Input and output is JSON, and it's easy to integrate with existing apps and REST architectures

// [.pane__frame--green.cols-2]
=== Stream & Batch API
image::icons/streambatch.png[,25,float="right",align="center"]
Stream and Batch APIs enable low latency access to streams of data changes and bulk get and put operations.
These APIs balance latency, throughput and fault-tolerance, providing comprehensive management of batch data while using stream processing to provide real-time access to data changes.

// [.pane__frame--pink.cols-2]
=== JSON data modelling
image::icons/json.png[,25,float="right",align="center"]
Couchbase Mobile uses JSON as its lightweight and flexible data modeling language.
All data is stored and transmitted as JSON, including the embedded database, the database server, REST APIs, stream APIs, and batch APIs

// [.pane__card--orange.cols-2]
=== Database Server
image::icons/couchbaseserver.png[,25,float="right",align="center"]
Couchbase Server, our database server, manages and stores data in the cloud.
It scales easily to billions of records and terabytes of data, supports millions of concurrent users, and provides 24x365 uptime.
