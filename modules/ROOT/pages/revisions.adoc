== Introduction

_Documents_ and _buckets_ (collections of, usually related, documents) are the basic units of data within Couchbase.

Remember that within Couchbase Mobile a document comprises:

* A Document ID
* A current revision ID
* A JSON body
* Metadata

Each change to a document (even its creation and deletion) is recorded as a _revision_.
The document's <<lbl-revs, revisions>> are contained within its _metadata_, which stores the
revision history as a  <<lbl-revtree, revision tree>>.

Note that binary data such images, audio and other multimedia objects are stored separately from the document, in an entity known as a _blob_ (or _attachment_).
Changes to _blobs_ do not generate revisions.


[#lbl-revs]
== Revisions

Couchbase creates a revision whenever a document is created, updated or deleted.
So, each document comprises a series of one or more revisions, a _revision tree_.

Each revision is given a unique _Revision ID_ in addition to the _Document ID_.

We use the 'revision id' to resolve conflicts arising when making concurrent changes to replicated copies of distributed data.
It comprises two parts:

* a generation ID +
This is a sequential auto-incrementing number. It is specific to the database on which the document resides.
Couchbase Lite generates simple integers.
Sync Gateway generates more complex long base64 values. +
The contents of remote revision IDs are implementation dependent.
Do not base any processing logic on their contents.
* a hash derived from the document contents


[#lbl-revtree]
== Revision Trees

A document's _revision tree_ comprises each revision -- in sequence -- made to the document throughout its lifetime to date.
The tip of that tree, the _leaf_ node, is the _current revision_ -- the most recent version of the document.

A revision tree's growth is unlimited.
We periodically remove obsolete revisions to maintain performance levels.
This process is known as <<lbl-prune>>.


[#lbl-prune]
==  Revision Tree Pruning
In the section::
<<lbl-alg>> | <<lbl-rtctrl>> | <<lbl-rtcons>> | <<lbl-rt-more>>

Pruning is the process of removing obsolete revisions.
It automatically runs when we add a revision.

Use the Admin Rest API endpoint for {rest-api-admin--xref--database-configuration} to provision any configuration changes to properties described in this content.


[#lbl-alg]
=== Algorithm
Although fundamentally the same, the pruning algorithm works slightly differently between Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite.

On Sync Gateway, the pruning algorithm is applied to the shortest, non-tombstoned branch in the revision tree.

The algorithm allows the branch to retain a configurable number of revisions (revs_limit) and removes all older revisions.


[#lbl-rtctrl]
=== Controls
You can vary the number of retained revisions using the Configuration File's  {configuration-schema-database--xref--revs-limit} setting.

So, for example, with a `revs_limit` of 1,000 the algorithm will keep the last 1,000 revisions in the shortest non-tombstoned branch and remove any others from that branch.

[NOTE]
--
Do not set `revs_limit` below 100 when `allow_conflicts = true` +
*Otherwise* ... you may adversely affect the conflict resolution process, as there may be insufficient revision history to resolve a given conflict.
--


[#lbl-rtcons]
=== Constraints
The default and minimum values of `revs_limit` are dependent on whether {configuration-schema-database--xref--allow-conflicts} is  True or False.

The presence of multiple unresolved conflicts in a revision tree can impair the pruning process.
It may result in obsolete revisions not being pruned or in the premature pruning of revisions.


[#lbl-rt-more]

[#lbl-caching]
== Revision Caching
In this section::
<<lbl-ctrl>> | <<lbl-size>> | <<lbl-sharding>> | <<lbl-deltasync>> | <<lbl-disable>>

Whenever a document is accessed its revision tree (or at least some portion of its revision tree) is also cached.


[#lbl-ctrl]
=== Control
You can control the size of the revision cache using the {configuration-schema-database--xref--cache--rev-cache} settings within the configuration file, specifically:

* {configuration-schema-database--xref--cache--rev-cache--size}
* {configuration-schema-database--xref--cache--rev-cache--shard-count}


[#lbl-size]
=== Size
Use the {configuration-schema-database--xref--cache--rev-cache--size} setting to specify the total number of document revisions to be cached in memory for all (recently accessed) documents.

When the revision cache is full, Sync Gateway will remove older document revisions to make room for newer ones.

By adjusting this setting you can fine-tune Sync Gateway's memory consumption.
This can be useful when working on servers with limited memory and in cases when Sync Gateway creates and-or updated many new documents relative to the number of read operations.


[#lbl-sharding]
=== Sharding
include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=ee-only-feature]

The *Community Edition* is configured with the default value and ignores any {configuration-schema-database--xref--cache--rev-cache--shard-count} value in the configuration file.

You can control the number of shards into which Sync Gateway will split its revisions cache by using the
{configuration-schema-database--xref--cache--rev-cache--shard-count}

More shards means lower cache contention when accessing distinct revisions, at the cost of some memory overhead per-shard.

IMPORTANT: Do not change the default xref:configuration-schema-database.adoc#database-cache-rev_cache-shard_count[database.cache.rev_cache.shard_count] unless advised to do so by Couchbase Support -- see: {url-cb-support-policy}.


[#lbl-deltasync]
=== Delta Sync and Revisions
include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=ee-only-feature]

When executing a write operation with delta_sync enabled the revision body is backed up in the bucket and retained for {configuration-schema-database--xref--delta-sync-max-age}, during which time it is available for the  calculation of future revision deltas.

As a result, new deltas can only be generated for read requests that come in within the {configuration-schema-database--xref--delta-sync-max-age} time window.

Storing backed up revision bodies for delta sync incurs additional bucket storage, the size of which equates to: +
`(doc_size * updates_per_day * 86400) / rev_max_age_seconds` -- see <<ex-deltastor>>.

[#ex-deltastor]
.Calculating Additional Delta-Sync Storage
====
Enabling delta sync would take up an additional 400 KB of storage on Couchbase Server, assuming:

* The default {`rev_max_age_seconds`} value
* An average document size of 4 KB
* 100 writes/day

Equating to: `(4 * 100 * 86400)/86400 = 400 KB`
====

Setting {configuration-schema-database--xref--delta-sync-max-age} to zero will generate deltas opportunistically on pull replications, with no additional storage requirements.


[#lbl-disable]
=== Disabling the Revision Cache

include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=ee-only-feature]

Disabling the revision cache can be useful when there are very large documents or if you expect a very low cache hit rate.
Otherwise it can negatively impact the latency of replications.

NOTE: Do not disable the revision cache, unless advised to do so by Couchbase Support -- see: {url-cb-support-policy}.

To disable the revision cache entirely, set {configuration-schema-database--xref--cache--rev-cache--size} to zero.
Community Edition ignores a zero setting.
