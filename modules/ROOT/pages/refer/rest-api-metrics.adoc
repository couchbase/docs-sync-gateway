== Overview

include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tag="developer-preview"]

*This API is OFF by default*.
To activate the API you will need to configure it using the `metricsInterface` setting in the configuration file

When activated, this API exposes two endpoints:

* _metrics -- which returns Sync Gateway statistics in Prometheus format +
`GET host:/4986/_metrics`
* _expvars -- which returns the same Sync Gateway statistics in JSON format +

For information on integration with Prometheus -- see our blog entry {url-blog-prometheus}.
