This API currently exposes two endpoints on port 4986:

* _metrics -- which returns Sync Gateway statistics in Prometheus format +
`GET host:/4986/_metrics`
* _expvars -- which returns the same Sync Gateway statistics in JSON format +

For information on integration with Prometheus -- see our blog entry {url-blog-prometheus}.
