[[active-replicator]]
Active replicator::
// tag::sgw-icr-active-replicator-full[]
// tag::sgw-icr-active-replicator[]
The term _active replicator_, refers to the Sync Gateway endpoint that initiates the replication connection.
That is, it s the Sync Gateway where the replicators are configured and from which the changes are pushed.
// end::sgw-icr-active-replicator[]
+
* _Synonym(s)_: active sync gateway
* _SGW Component_: Inter-sync-gateway replication

[[adhoc-replication]]
Adhoc Replication::
+
--
// tag::sgw-icr-adhoc-replication-full[]
// tag::sgw-icr-adhoc-replication-def[]
// tag::sgw-icr-adhoc-replication[]
The term _adhoc replication_ refers to transient, one-shot, replications that run once and are removed when they stop.
They are initialized using the Admin REST API.
They do not survive Sync Gateway restarts.
// end::sgw-icr-adhoc-replication[]

Ad hoc replications are useful when it is necessary to do one off replication or for troubleshooting.

Other useful use cases include:

* Starting a replication on-demand, for instance a replication that needs to be scheduled to be run at midnight every Thursday. +
In this case, it is likely that there is an automation script that schedules the adhoc replication on a predefined schedule.
* Deploying an emergency one-time update that needs to be pushed out to all edge clusters from primary data clusters.
// end::sgw-icr-adhoc-replication-def[]

// tag::conflict-resolver-policies-full[]
[[conflict-resolver-policies]]
Conflict Resolver Policies::
// tag::conflict-resolver-policies-summary[]
Inter-Sync-gateway Replications provides several predefined conflict resolver policies, which you can choose to apply.
These include: `default; `localWins`, `remoteWins`; and `custom`.
// end::conflict-resolver-policies-summary[]
+
--
// tag::conflict-resolver-policies-body[]
Each conflict resolver policy applies a different strategy:

Default::
* Always applies Sync Gateway's <<auto-conflict-resolution-policy>>
* Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "default"`

Local Wins::
* Always considers the local change the winner.
* Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "localWins"`

Remote Wins::
* Always considers the remote change the winner.
* Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "remoteWins"`

Custom::
+
NOTE: {enterprise} Only

--
* Applies the policy defined in the function provided by the `custom_conflict_resolution` parameter
* Configured using:

[[cloud-to-edge]]
Cloud-to-Edge Sync::
// tag::sgw-cloud-to-edge-full[]
// tag::sgw-cloud-to-edge-def[]
// tag::sgw-cloud-to-edge[]
The term _cloud-to-edge_ refers to the multi-cloud deployment mode commonly know as _ship-to-shore_ or _hub-and-spoke_.
These typically involve a large number of edge clusters (mobiles,, tablets IoT) connected to one or more cloud data centers.
// end::sgw-cloud-to-edge[]

Each edge can operate autonomously without network connectivity to the cloud data centers.
The _edge_ could be, for example a group of retail stores, ships at sea or distribution hubs.

Inter-sync-gateway Replication::
// tag::sgw-inter-sync-gateway-replication-full[]

The term _inter-sync-gateway replication_ refers to replication between
two Sync Gateway clusters and-or between Active mobile clusters.
// tag::sgw-inter-sync-gateway-replication[]
+
Inter-sync-gateway replication within Sync Gateway is delivered by the Inter-sync-gateway Replication (v2) protocol, which enables a Sync Gateway replicator to act as the _{glos-term-active-replicator}_, pulling changes from a data source and pushing them to a target.

// end::sgw-conf-res-leaf-revision[]

{goto-index}

== N

[[no-conflicts-mode]]
No conflicts mode::
// tag::sgw-conf-res-no-conflicts[]
No conflicts mode is the process by which write operations that would result in a conflict are rejected by the system.
It is an optional feature in xref:couchbase-lite::swift.adoc#handling-conflicts[Couchbase Lite 2.0 and above] and xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-allow_conflicts[Sync Gateway 2.0 and above].

--
// tag::sgw-conf-no-op-update-full[]
// tag::sgw-conf-no-op-update[]
The term _no-op update_ refers to a change made to the document body that does not impact application logic but does trigger a replication by the Sync Gateway.
// end::sgw-conf-no-op-update[]

For example, you may include an otherwise redundant _counter_ property, that you increment in response to conflict resolver errors.
// tag::sgw-conf-no-op-update-context[]

[[rep-oneshot]]
One-shot replication mode::
// tag::glos-term-rep-oneshot[]

[[persistent-exponential-backoff]]
Persistent Exponential Backoff::
The wait time between retry attempts is exponentially increased at each attempt, until it reaches a predetermined maximum limit.
Subsequent retries may be made after the maximum limit time period has elapsed.


[[persistent-replication]]
Persistent Replication::
// tag::sgw-icr-persistent-replication-full[]
// tag::sgw-icr-persistent-replication-def[]
// tag::sgw-icr-persistent-replication[]
The term _Persistent replication_ refers to replications that survive Sync Gateway restarts.
All replications are persisted by default unless explicitly flagged as not.
// end::sgw-icr-persistent-replication[]
Persistent replication is defined in the configuration file sync-gateway.json (see {xref-sgw-pg-cofig-properties}.
It is started automatically and survives restarts.
The recommended method of defining a persistent replication is by using the configuration file.
With SG Replicate 2.0 you can configure all nodes with the replicators.

[[replication-definition]]
Replication definition::
+
--
// tag::glos-term-replication-definition-full[]
// tag::glos-term-replication-definition[]
The term _Replication definition_ refers to that set of elements (parameters or properties) that define a replication, dictating what will be replicated and how the replication will be conducted.
// end::glos-term-replication-definition[]

Replication definitions are provided to Sync Gateway in 'JSON' format through either:

* The Sync Gateway configuration file  (`sync-gateway-config.json`)
* The Admin REST API's `_replication` endpoint, using a utility such as `curl`, or an application such as _Postman_.

_Replication definitions_ comprise the same elements in both the JSON configuration file and the Admin REST API; except configured replications cannot use `adhoc` or  `cancel`.


// end::glos-term-replication-definition-full[]

[[revision-pruning]]
Revision pruning::
// tag::sgw-conf-res-revision-pruning[]
Revision Pruning is the process that deletes the metadata and/or JSON bodies associated with old non-leaf revisions.
Leaf revisions are not impacted.

[[sync-gateway-database]]
Sync Gateway Database::
// tag::sgw-icr-sync-gateway-database[]

// end::sgw-icr-sync-gateway-database[]

== T

[[tombstone-revision]]
Tombstone revision::
// tag::sgw-conf-res-tombstone[]
A tombstone revision is essentially a marker indicating that a document has been deleted.

Each Tombstone Revision comprises: document ID, revision ID and a _deleted flag (value=true).
They are created to allow all devices to see that a document has been deleted - particularly in the case of devices that may not be online continuously and therefore not syncing regularly.

Every update -- including deletes -- creates a document revision.
Deleted revisions are also known as _Tombstone_ revisions.
They have the '“_deleted”: true' property, are replicated, but are not returned if you do a query using, for example, Couchbase Lite.
