== Introduction

This is Sync Gateway's long-established method of configuration.
It uses a centralized Configuration Properties file to hold all configuration settings in JSON form -- see:<<lbl-schema,the schema>> for the file contents.

include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=disable-persistent-config]

Many configuration settings can be changed using the {rest-api-admin--xref} but these are not persisted beyond a Sync Gateway restart.
To make persistent changes you must edit the central Configuration Properties file.


[#lbl-format]
== File Format

The Configuration Properties file defines sync gateway's runtime behavior.
Its contents include, for example:

* Details of the connected Couchbase databases
* How replications are conducted
* What security is to be used
* What logging options are to be applied, and
* Any customization of import filtering and synchronization.

The majority of the configuration is achieved using standard JSON syntax -- see <<lbl-schema,the schema>> for more.

[NOTE]
--
The `sync-gateway-config.json` file relies on the use of one _relaxed_ JSON feature; the use of back ticks  (`++`++`).
Text between back ticks is treated as a string.
It can span multiple lines and contain double-quotes.
Those features make it ideal for the incorporation of inline JavaScript, which can be used to provision, for example, `sync` and `import_filter` functions.
