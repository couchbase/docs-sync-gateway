== Configuration

Add the `sync` function defined below into your `sync-gateway-config.json`:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$getting-started/sync-gateway-config-sync-func.json[]
----
Configuration properties:

<1> The user's username that you created on the Couchbase Server Admin Console.
<2> The user's password that you created on the Couchbase Server Admin Console.
<3> The {xref-pfx}shared-bucket-access.adoc[shared bucket access] feature allows Couchbase Server SDKs to also perform operations on this bucket.
<4> `num_index_replicas` is the number of index replicas stored in Couchbase Server, introduced with {xref-pfx}indexing.adoc[GSI/N1QL indexing].
If you're running a single Couchbase Server node for development purposes the `num_index_replicas` must be set to `0`.
<5> The sync function -- a javascript function enclosed in backticks, which is actioned every time a new document, document revision or deletion is made to a data base (see: xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-sync[databases.$db.sync] property).
