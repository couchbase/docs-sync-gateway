== Introduction

{sgw-te} 3.0 introduces {ec-te}, to better suit its use in increasingly prevalent multi-node, multi-cluster deployments.
{ec-s} replaces the established, file-based configuration method {fnfbc}, supporting the move away from a reliance on increasingly monolithic central configuration files.
It enables simpler, more agile configuration updates and encompasses:

* *Bootstrap Startup* +
A minimal configuration file is used to bootstrap a {sgw} node and attach it to its Couchbase Server cluster; these files and their settings are node-specific -- see the {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref}

* *Dynamic Configuration* +
The ability to make remote in-flight configuration changes to database settings, access-control policies and inter-{sgw} replications, enables simpler and more agile maintenance.

* *Cluster-aware Updates* +
Configuration changes made to a node through the API endpoints are propagated to other {sgw} nodes belonging to the same cluster (or to a user-defined subset of nodes) -- <<lbl-config-grp>>

* *Persistent Updates* +
Any database changes made using the API endpoints are persisted and survive {sgw} node restarts (this does note apply when running in file-base configuration mode).

* *Secure REST API* +
by default the REST API requires TLS authentication -- see {secure-sgw-access--xref}.
This can be disabled for test purposes only.

* *Automatic upgrade path* +
Your existing pre-3.x configuration files will (optionally) be automatically converted, on start-up, to the new format for {ec}.


== Workflow

In the {sgw-te} {ec-l} ecosphere you provide a minimal bootstrap configuration to get Sync Gateway started, then add users, roles, database and replications using the REST API.

.Configuration Workflow
image::persistent-config.png[,750]

. Set up a user for the Admin REST API on Couchbase Server +
Alternatively, you can disable authentication of REST API user(s) -- for test purposes *only*

. Provide a {sgw--xref}{configuration-schema-bootstrap--page}[bootstrap configuration file], in JSON format, which defines the {sgw} node's run time behavior.
This configuration is node-specific.
Any changes require a {sgw} restart.

. Add or amend configuration items in-flight using the Admin Rest API. +
All changes are persisted across {sgw} restarts.
Auto restarts will be initiated for ny change that requires one.
You will need to configure and maintain:

.. Databases +
Use the Admin REST API endpoint {sgw--xref}{rest-api-admin-database--page}[Database Configuration] endpoints to add required databases.

.. Database Security +
Use the {sgw--xref}{rest-api-admin-db-security--page}[Database Security] endpoints to configure users and roles.

.. Access Control +
Use the {sgw--xref}{rest-api-admin-access-control--page}[Access Control] endpoints to configure your Sync Function.

.. Inter-Sync Gateway replications +
Use the {sgw--xref}{rest-api-admin-isgr--page}[inter-{sgw} replication] endpoints to configure required replications.


== Key Terms

[#tbl-keyterms,cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===

|Term
|Description

|{sgw-t} Cluster
|A collection of {sgw} nodes connected to a common {svr} cluster

|Homogeneous {sgw-t} Cluster
|A {sgw} cluster where every node in cluster shares common configuration

|{sgw-t} Config Group
|A group of {sgw} nodes within a {sgw} cluster sharing common configuration.
Each node in the group will continue to have node-specific config.

|Static
|In a configuration context, this term is used to identify changes requiring a {sgw} node restart to take effect.

|Dynamic
|In a configuration context, this term is used to identify changes requiring NO {sgw} restart.
So, for example, anything modifiable using REST API endpoint is a dynamic configuration property.

Note that, in some cases, such changes may require the database be taken offline/online before it takes effect.

|===


== Configuration Levels

All the configuration properties, whether defined in the bootstrap configuration file or by the REST API endpoint belong to one of three core 'levels': _node_, _database_  or _replication_ -- see <<tbl-cfg-levels>>

.Configuration levels in {ec}
[#tbl-cfg-levels,cols="1,1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
2+|Level
|Use
|Scope
|Requires

.3+|Node
|Bootstrap properties
|Minimal set of configuration properties required for connection to {svr} bucket, for example server credentials, and group id
|Node-specific; unshared
|Restart required

|Static system properties
|Static node level properties including, for example, `api.tls.cert_path` and `max_file_descriptors`
|Node-specific; unshared
|Restart required

|Dynamic system properties
|All logging-related properties are dynamic
|Node-specific; unshared; not persisted
|No restart


2+|Database
| Database configuration properties including, for example, `bucket`, or access control policies such as `users` and `sync`
|May be node-specific, but typically shared across nodes in same group
|Restart initiated as needed


2+|Replication
|inter-{sgw} replication properties
|Shared across all participating replication nodes
|Restart initiated as needed

|===

To continue operating in this mode ensure that you use the command-line interface option `disable_persistent_config=true`.
This ensures the pre-3.0 configuration approach is continued.


[#lbl-auth]
== Authenticated API Access

Secure TLS access (_https_ and-or _wss_) to the {sgw} ADMIN API is enabled by default.
You can disable it, for testing purposes *ONLY*, by omitting the {bootstrap-schema--xref--api-https-tls-key-path} and {bootstrap-schema--xref--api-https-tls-cert-path} options from the bootstrap config.

To use the {ec-te} you need to create an RBAC-user on {svr}
with an appropriate {sgw} role.
The user/TLS credentials are then declared in the bootstrap configuration.
This node-level user is used when connecting to database by default; unless over-ridden in the database configuration.

Cluster connection failures are subject to retries.


[#lbl-config-grp]
== Configuration Groups

You can group {sgw} nodes into homogenous clusters using the `Config-Group-ID` property ({bootstrap-schema--xref--bootstrap-group-id}).
This defines the database configuration group to which a node belongs.

All nodes in a group share the same database configuration.
Changes made from one node are propagated to other nodes in the group automatically.

All nodes in a cluster belong, by default, to a common shared group `default`.

If you move a {sgw} node to a new group, it will inherit the configuration associated with that group.
This applies also if you move a group (back) into the `default` group.
