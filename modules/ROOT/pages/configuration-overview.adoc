== Introduction

Sync Gateway can be configured to operate in static or dynamic-persistent configuration modes.

The static approach allows for a controlled transition to a dynamic and persistent configuration process that delivers simpler and safer configuration maintenance (and propagation) for multi-node, multi-cluster deployments.


== Static Configuration

Sync Gateway's established method of configuration is to use a centralized JSON configuration file to hold all configuration settings -- see: {configuration-schema-static--xref}.

Changes can be made using the {rest-api-admin--xref} but these are not persistent beyond a Sync Gateway restart.

Persistent changes require edits to the central configuration file.

To continue operating in this mode ensure that you use the command-line interface option `disable_persistent_config=true`.
This ensures the pre-3.0 configuration approach is continued.

== Dynamic Persistent Configuration

Sync Gateway's dynamic persistent configuration approach
relies on a small bootstrap configuration with dynamic configuration of databases, replications and users being done using the REST API.

In the dynamic persistent configuration approach you will provide:

* A bootstrap configuration file, which contains a core amount of configuration in JSON form.
This defines Sync Gateways run time behavior and static settings.

* A database configuration for each replicated database.
The {configuration-schema-database--xref} defines the required database settings. It is provisioned using the {rest-api-admin-database--xref}.
Changes persist across Sync Gateway restarts.

* An access-control configuration using the {configuration-schema-access-control--xref}, which defines the settings provisioned using the {rest-api-admin-access-control--xref}.
Changes persist across Sync Gateway restarts.

* An inter-Sync Gateway Replication configuration using the {configuration-schema-isgr--xref}, which defines the settings provisioned using the {rest-api-admin-isgr--xref}.
Changes persist across Sync Gateway restarts.
