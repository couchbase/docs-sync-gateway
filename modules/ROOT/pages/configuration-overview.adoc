== Introduction

{sgw-te} 3.0 introduces {ec-te}, to better suit its use in increasingly prevalent multi-node, multi-cluster deployments.
{ec-s} replaces the established, file-based configuration method {fnfbc}, supporting the move away from a reliance on increasingly monolithic central configuration files.
It enables simpler, more agile configuration updates and encompasses:

* *Bootstrap Startup* +
A minimal configuration file is used to bootstrap a {sgw} node and attach it to its Couchbase Server cluster; these files and their settings are node-specific -- see the {configuration-schema-bootstrap--xref}

* *Dynamic Configuration* +
The ability to make remote in-flight configuration changes to database settings, access-control policies and inter-{sgw} replications, enables simpler and more agile maintenance.

* *Cluster-aware Updates* +
Configuration changes made to a node through the API endpoints are propagated to other {sgw} nodes belonging to the same cluster (or to a user-defined subset of nodes) -- <<lbl-config-grp>>

* *Persistent Updates* +
Any database changes made using the API endpoints are persisted and survive {sgw} node restarts (this does not apply when running in file-based configuration mode).

* *Secure REST API* +
by default the REST API requires authentication and authorization using Couchbase Server RBAC-user credentials -- see {secure-sgw-access--xref}.
This can be disabled for test purposes only.

* *Automatic upgrade path* +
Your existing legacy Pre-3.0 configuration files will (optionally) be automatically converted, on start-up, to the new format for {ec}.


== Workflow

In the {ec-te} ecosphere you provide a minimal bootstrap configuration to get Sync Gateway started, then add users, roles, database and replications using the REST API.

.Configuration Workflow
image::persistent-config.png[,750]

. Set up a user for the Admin REST API on Couchbase Server +
Alternatively, you can disable authentication of REST API user(s) -- for test purposes *only*

. Provide a {sgw--xref}{configuration-schema-bootstrap--page}[bootstrap configuration file], in JSON format, which defines the {sgw} node's run time behavior.
This configuration is node-specific.
Any changes require a {sgw} restart.

. Add or amend configuration items in-flight using the Admin Rest API. +
All changes are persisted across {sgw} restarts.
Auto restarts will be initiated for ny change that requires one.
You will need to configure and maintain:

.. Databases +
Use the Admin REST API endpoint {sgw--xref}{configuration-schema-database--page}[Database Configuration] endpoints to add required databases.

.. Database Security +
Use the {sgw--xref}{configuration-schema-db-security--page}[Database Security] endpoints to configure users and roles.

.. Access Control +
Use the {sgw--xref}{configuration-schema-access-control--page}[Access Control] endpoints to configure your Sync Function.

.. Inter-Sync Gateway replications +
Use the {sgw--xref}{configuration-schema--isgr--page}[inter-{sgw} replication] endpoints to configure required replications.


=== Opt-out

:no-admonition:
include::partial$block-caveats.adoc[tags=disable-persistent-config]

This ensures you can use the {configuration-properties-legacy--xref}.
Note that no Admin REST API changes are persisted across {sgw} restarts.


== Key Terms

[#tbl-keyterms,cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===

|Term
|Description

|{sgw-t} Cluster
|A collection of {sgw} nodes connected to a common {svr} cluster

|Homogeneous {sgw-t} Cluster
|A {sgw} cluster where every node in cluster shares common configuration

|{sgw-t} Config Group
|A group of {sgw} nodes within a {sgw} cluster sharing common configuration.
Each node in the group will continue to have node-specific config.

// |Static
// |In a configuration context, this term is used to identify changes requiring a {sgw} node restart to take effect.

// |Dynamic
// |In a configuration context, this term is used to identify changes requiring NO {sgw} restart.
// So, for example, anything modifiable using REST API endpoint is a dynamic configuration property.

// Note that, in some cases, such changes may require the database be taken offline/online before it takes effect.

|===


== Configuration Levels

All the configuration properties, whether defined in the bootstrap configuration file or by the Admin REST API endpoint belong to one of two core 'levels': _node_ or _database_ -- see <<tbl-cfg-levels>>

.Configuration levels in {ec}
[#tbl-cfg-levels,cols="1,1,2,2,2", options="header"]

.3+|Node
| Couchbase Server connection
|Minimal set of configuration properties required for connection to {svr} bucket, for example server credentials, and group id
|Node-specific; unshared

|System properties

|Node-specific; unshared
|Yes, file-edit +
Restart required

|Logging properties
|Logging-related properties
|Node-specific; unshared

No restart, but *not persisted*


.2+|Database
| DB properties
| Database configuration properties including, for example, `bucket`, or access control policies such as `users` and `sync`
|May be node-specific, but typically shared across nodes in same group
|Yes, by Admin REST API +
Restart initiated as needed


|Replication properties
|inter-{sgw} replication properties
|Shared across all participating replication nodes
|Yes, by Admin REST API +
Restart initiated as needed

[#lbl-auth]
== Secure Administration

// Secure TLS access (_https_ and-or _wss_) to the {sgw} ADMIN API is enabled by default.
// You can disable it, for testing purposes *ONLY*, by omitting the {bootstrap-schema--xref--api-https-tls-key-path} and {bootstrap-schema--xref--api-https-tls-cert-path} options from the bootstrap config.
include::{rest-api-access--page}[tags=secremacc]

For more see: {rest-api-access--xref}


[#lbl-config-grp]
== Configuration Groups

You can group {sgw} nodes into homogenous clusters using the `Config-Group-ID` property ({bootstrap-schema--xref--bootstrap-group-id}).
This defines the database configuration group to which a node belongs.

All nodes in a group share the same database configuration.
Changes made from one node are propagated to other nodes in the group automatically.

All nodes in a cluster belong, by default, to a common shared group `default`.

If you move a {sgw} node to a new group, it will inherit the configuration associated with that group.
This applies also if you move a group (back) into the `default` group.
