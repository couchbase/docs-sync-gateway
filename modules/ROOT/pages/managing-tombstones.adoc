= Managing Tombstones

By design, when a document is deleted in Couchbase Mobile, they are not actually deleted from the database, but simply marked as deleted (by setting the `_deleted` property). The reason that documents are not immediately removed is to allow all devices to see that they have been deleted - particularly in the case of devices that may not be online continuously and therefore not syncing regularly.

== Purging Tombstones

To remove tombstones, you need to purge them.
The following tables describe how to purge tombstones (automatically or manually) and reset the Sync Gateway channel cache when Shared Bucket Access is enabled or disabled.

|===
2+a|*Automatic purging of tombstones*
|`enable_shared_bucket_access: false`
|`enable_shared_bucket_access: true`
|Tombstones can be automatically purged from the bucket by setting a server expiry on tombstone documents.
This can be easily automated via SG using the xref:sync-function-api.adoc#expiry[expiry()] function in the Sync Function.
The expiry time should be sufficient (perhaps a week, or a month) to allow for all other devices to sync and receive the delete notification.
|Tombstones are automatically purged from the bucket based on the server's metadata purge interval.

|===
2+a|*Manually purging tombstones*
|`enable_shared_bucket_access: false`
|`enable_shared_bucket_access: true`
|Tombstones can be manually removed via Sync Gateway's xref:admin-rest-api.adoc#/document/post\__db___purge[+/{db}/_purge+] endpoint, or deleting documents directly in the bucket.
|Tombstones can be manually removed via Sync Gateway's xref:admin-rest-api.adoc#/document/post\__db___purge[+/{db}/_purge+] endpoint.
|===

Purging of tombstones is also required on Couchbase Lite.
For example, you might decide that if a document is deleted on a Couchbase Lite client, that you want to purge the document (on that device) as soon as the delete has been successfully replicated out to Sync Gateway.

== Cache Ejection

Deleted/expired tombstones aren't automatically ejected from Sync Gateway's in-memory channel caches.
The following table describes how to eject Sync Gateway's cache.

|===
|`enable_shared_bucket_access: false`|`enable_shared_bucket_access: true`

2+a|*For tombstones purged on Couchbase Server*
a|
* Restarting Sync Gateway will flush the cache

* Restarting Sync Gateway will flush the cache.
* Starting in 2.1.1, running the xref:admin-rest-api.adoc#/database/post\__db___compact[+/{db}/_compact+] endpoint will remove purged tombstones from the channel cache.


2+a|*For documents purged on Sync Gateway*
a|
* Restarting Sync Gateway will flush the cache.
* Starting in 2.1.1, this is done automatically.

== Tombstone Lifecycle

The storage location of tombstones differs slightly depending on whether the Shared Bucket Access feature is enabled (`enable_shared_bucket_access: true`).
The table below describes those differences.

|===
|`enable_shared_bucket_access: false`|`enable_shared_bucket_access: true`

2+a|*Mobile metadata storage location*
|Persisted on the document (`doc._sync`)
|Persisted as system extended attributes (`xattr._sync`)

2+a|*Tombstone storage location*
|Persisted on the document
|Persisted as system extended attributes (`xattr._sync`).

2+a|*Additional properties on a tombstone*
|Persisted on the document
|Not persisted.

NOTE: Setting additional properties on tombstones may appear to be successful through Couchbase Lite SDKs or the Sync Gateway REST APIs but those properties will not be persisted to Couchbase Server.

Document operations also have a different impact on tombstones when Shared Bucket Access is enabled/disabled.

|===
|`enable_shared_bucket_access: false`|`enable_shared_bucket_access: true`

2+a|*Deleting a document through Sync Gateway*

2+a|*Deleting a document body in the bucket (SDK, N1QL, expiry)*
|Removes the document and metadata
|Creates a tombstone

2+a|*Purging a document's metadata (on Couchbase Server)*
|N/A
|Removes the tombstone metadata
