== Introduction

Sync Gateway's bootstrap configuration is provisioned in a JSON format file, which defines its runtime behavior - see <<Configuration Reference>> for more details on the file content.

Sync Gateway will look for the following configuration file unless you direct it otherwise: +
`/home/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json`

// [NOTE]
// ====
// The `sync-gateway-config.json` file relies on the use of one _relaxed_ JSON feature; the use of back ticks  (`++`++`).
// Text between back ticks is treated as a string.
// It can span multiple lines and contain double-quotes.
// Those features make it ideal for the incorporation of inline JavaScript, which can be used to provision, for example, `sync` and `import_filter` functions.
// ====

Use the following command to run Sync Gateway with a configuration file:

[source, bashrc]
----
sync_gateway sync-gateway-bootstrap.json
