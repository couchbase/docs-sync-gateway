              Introduced in Sync Gateway 2.0, this property can be used to disable Sync Gateway's handling of conflicts.

              Setting to `false` will cause Sync Gateway to reject any attempt to write conflicting revisions (returning a `409` HTTP status code). It will be up to the client to resolve the conflict. Restarting Sync Gateway with this property enabled will not automatically result in disk space savings (compaction on a document won't occur until a document is updated).

          delta_sync:
            type: object
            description: |
              *NOTE:* Delta Sync is an Enterprise Edition feature on Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite.

              Delta Sync is the ability to replicate only parts of the Couchbase mobile document that have changed. This can result in significant savings in bandwidth consumption as well as throughput improvements, especially when network bandwidth is typically constrained.

              Delta Sync incurs additional bucket storage requirements which can be tuned with the [`rev_max_age_seconds`](#databases-foo_db-delta_sync-rev_max_age_seconds) property.

              Delta Sync does not apply to attachment contents.

              Delta Sync is disabled by default on the Sync Gateway. You can enable it through the `enabled` property.

              If delta sync is enabled on Sync Gateway, then Couchbase Lite clients will switch to using delta sync automatically.
              Similarly, if delta sync is disabled on Sync Gateway, clients will switch to normal mode.

              The following configuration example enables delta sync.

              ```javascript
              {
                "logging": {
                  "console": {
                    "log_keys": ["*"]
                  }
                },
                "databases": {
                  "db": {
                    "server": "http://localhost:8091",
                    "bucket": "default",
                    "users": { "GUEST": { "disabled": false, "admin_channels": ["*"] } },
                    "allow_conflicts": false,
                    "revs_limit": 20,
                    "delta_sync": {
                      "enabled": true,
                      "rev_max_age_seconds": 86400
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
              ```

              Foot notes:

              - Delta Sync is automatically enabled for peer-to-peer sync between Couchbase Lite clients.
              - Delta sync is disabled for Couchbase Lite database replicas.
            properties:
              enabled:
                type: boolean
                description: Set this property to "true" to enable delta sync.
                default: 'false'
              rev_max_age_seconds:
                type: integer
                description: |
                  On a write operation, the revision body is backed up in the bucket and retained for `rev_max_age_seconds` to calculate future revision deltas.
                  As a result, new deltas can only be generated for read requests that come in within the `rev_max_age_seconds` time window.
                  The storage of backed up revision bodies for delta sync incurs additional bucket storage requirements.

                  The additional storage can be calculated with the following formula: `(doc_size * updates_per_day * 86400) / rev_max_age_seconds`.

                  For example, with `rev_max_age_seconds`'s default value, an average document size of 4 KB and 100 writes/day, enabling delta sync would take up an additional 400 KB of storage on Couchbase Server (`(4 * 100 * 86400)/86400`).

                  Setting this value to 0 will generate deltas opportunistically on pull replications, with no additional storage requirements.

          import_docs:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5, this property specifies whether this Sync Gateway node should perform import processing.

              This property works in conjunction with the [enable_shared_bucket_access](#databases-foo_db-enable_shared_bucket_access) property.

              Starting in Sync Gateway 2.7, all Sync Gateway nodes can be configured as import nodes. This results in performance benefits as the import process is shared across all Sync Gateway nodes.

              Prior to version 2.7, `import_docs` can only be set to `true` on a single node.

              #### Workload Isolation

              Starting in version 2.7, if `enable_shared_bucket_access` is set to `true` and `import_docs` is set to `false`, the node will not be participating in the import process.

              This configuration is specifically recommended for workload isolation: to isolate import nodes from the client-facing nodes. Workload isolation is preferable in deployments with a large write throughput.

              Prior to Release 2.1 a value of 'continuous' was also allowed. This was deprecated at Release 2.1 and replaced with the boolean value True. There is no change to the behavior or functionality (that is, a value of 'continuous' was interpreted as True and had the same effect).

            default: false
          import_partitions:
            type: integer
            description: |
              Allows users to tune the number of partitions used for import processing. Partitions are distributed among all Sync Gateway nodes participating in import processing (import_docs:true), and each process a subset of the server's vbuckets.

              Each partition is processed by a separate goroutine, so import_partitions can be used to tune concurrency based on the number of Sync Gateway nodes, and the number of cores per node.
            default: 16

              This property is optional for X.509 authentication. If it isn't provided, Sync Gateway will accept any certificate provided by Couchbase Server.

                    default: 60
                  max_number:
                    type: integer
                    description: |
                      Tuning this property is an [Enterprise Edition](https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions) feature.
                      The Community Edition is configured with the default value, and will ignore any value in the configuration file.

                      Maximum number of channel caches which will exist at any one point. This property is used to determine the cache size (and the associated eviction watermarks `compact_low_watermark_pct`/`compact_high_watermark_pct`).

                      The default value for this property is 50000. Along with the default channel `min_length` and `max_length` values, this would result in a memory usage under 1GB.

                      The `max_number` value can be tuned to optimize for cache hits (requests that are handled using the cache), as opposed to cache misses (requests that require a round-trip to Couchbase Server to fetch data). The cache hit/miss ratio can be obtained with the following:

                      cache hit/miss ratio = `cache.chan_cache_hits` / `cache.chan_cache_misses`

                      Increasing the `max_number` value can increase the cache hit/miss ratio, resulting in better cache utilization.

                      If the cache size grows to reach the high watermark (`compact_high_watermark_pct`), channels with no connected replications will be evicted before channels which are associated with an active pull replication (i.e a blip-based pull replication in Couchbase Lite 2.x, or an active `/{db}/_changes` request in Couchbase Lite 1.x).

                      The minimum allowed value is 100.

                      It isn't possible to remove the limit altogether, users who wish to remove the limit would need to set `max_number` to an arbitrarily high value.

Adjust this property to tune memory consumption by Sync Gateway, for example on servers with less memory and in cases when Sync Gateway creates many new documents and/or updates many documents relative to the number of read operations.

                      ##### Disabling the revision cache

                      Disabling the revision cache is an [Enterprise Edition](https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions) feature.

                      To disable the revision entirely, set this property to 0. Setting this property to 0 on the Community Edition is ignored.

                      Disabling the revision cache would be useful when there are very large documents or if you expect a very low cache hit rate. Otherwise it could negatively impact the latency of replications. It is generally not recommended to disable the revision cache, unless advised by Couchbase [Enterprise Support](https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy).

                      Tuning this property is an [Enterprise Edition](https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions) feature.
                      The Community Edition is configured with the default value, and will ignore any value in the configuration file.

                      Number of shards the rev cache should be split into. More shards allows for lower cache contention when accessing distinct revisions, at the cost of some memory overhead per-shard. This generally should not greatly exceed the number of CPU threads available to Sync Gateway.

                      It is generally not recommended to set this property, unless advised by Couchbase [Enterprise Support](https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy).

          enable_shared_bucket_access:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5, this property specifies whether to enable Mobile-Server Data Sync (a.k.a _mobile convergence_). You can learn more about this functionality [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/shared-bucket-access.html)

              This property works in conjunction with the [import_docs](#databases-foo_db-import_docs) property.

              `enable_shared_bucket_access` needs to be `true` on all nodes participating in such a configuration where as `import_docs` can only be set to `true` on a single node.

              On start-up, Sync Gateway will generate the mobile-specific metadata for all the pre-existing documents in the Couchbase Server bucket. From then on, documents can be inserted on the Server directly (with N1QL or SDKs) or through the Sync Gateway REST API.

              #### Tombstones

              When `enable_shared_bucket_access` is enabled, mobile tombstones are now also server tombstones. The document body is deleted, and only the mobile sync metadata required to replicate the tombstone is retained in the mobile extended attribute.

              The server's metadata purge interval becomes an important consideration for mobile deployments under convergence. When the server purges a tombstone (based on the metadata purge interval), that tombstone will no longer be replicated to mobile clients.

              Users should set the server's metadata purge interval based on their expected client replication frequency, to ensure that clients are notified of the tombstone prior to that tombstone being purged.

              NOTE: The default Metadata Purge Interval is set to 3 days which can potentially result in tombstones being purged before all clients have had a chance to get notified of it.

              Ways to tune the Metadata Purge Interval on Couchbase Server:

              - Bucket settings [on UI](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/settings/configure-compact-settings.html)
              - Bucket endpoint [on the REST API](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/rest-api/rest-bucket-create.html)

              #### Implementation notes for XATTRs:

              Mobile applications require additional metadata in order to manage security and replication. In previous versions of Sync Gateway, this information has always been stored in the document body. Sync Gateway 1.5 utilizes a new feature of Couchbase Server 5.0 called XATTRs (x-attributes) to store that metadata into an external document fragment.

              Extended attributes (xattrs) are JSON objects that can be associated with Couchbase documents. Each document can be associated with zero or more extended attributes. There are currently three types (user, system, virtual). Mobile Convergence uses a system extended attribute, which has the following characteristics central to convergence:

               - Shares lifetime with the document metadata - when a document is deleted, system xattrs are preserved with the tombstone.
               - Allocated 1MB of storage, independent of the 20MB available for the document

              Extended attributes are stored as part of the document, and are replicated with the document (both intra-cluster replication and XDCR).

              Extended attributes can be accessed via the SDKs using the sub-document API, via command-line tools, and via views.

              They are also accessible from N1QL in Couchbase Server 5.5 or above with the `().xattrs` property. For example, `SELECT meta().xattrs._sync from travel-sample where Meta().id = "user::demo";`.

              **WARNING:** The sync metadata is maintained internally by Sync Gateway and its structure can change at any time. It should not be used to drive business logic of applications. The direct use of the N1QL query is unsupported and must not be used in production environments.
              The `raw` endpoint ([/db/_raw/{docid}](../../../references/sync-gateway/admin-rest-api/index.html#!/document/get_db_raw_doc)) on Sync Gateway's Admin REST API returns both the document and it's associated mobile metadata.

            type: object
            description: Webhooks in Sync Gateway are designed to minimize performance impacts on Sync Gateway's regular processing. Sync Gateway manages the number of processes that are spawned for webhook event handling, so that slow response times from the HTTP POST operations don't consume available CPU resources on Sync Gateway nodes. When a `webhook` event handler is defined, after Sync Gateway has updated a document, Sync Gateway adds a `document_changed` event to an asynchronous event-processing queue (the event queue). New processes are then spawned to apply the `filter` function to the documents and to perform the HTTP POST operations. When an event is not added to the event queue, but is instead discarded, a warning message is written to the the Sync Gateway log. You can configure Sync Gateway to log information about event handling, by including either the log key `Event` or `Events+` in the `Log` property in your Sync Gateway configuration file. `Events+` is more verbose.

              This property defines the maximum depth to which a document's revision tree can grow; its value governs the point at which to prune a document's revision tree.

              The default and minimum values of `revs_limit` are dependent on whether [allow_conflicts](config-properties.html#databases-foo_db-allow_conflicts) is set True or False -- see the *Default and Minimum Values* table below.

              The process to remove obsolete revisions is called pruning and runs automatically every time a revision is added. Although fundamentally the same, the pruning algorithm works slightly differently between Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite. On Sync Gateway, the pruning algorithm is applied to the shortest, non-tombstoned branch in the revision tree.

              If there are conflicting revisions, the document may end up with **disconnected branches** after the pruning process. In the animation below, the document has a conflicting branch (revisions `4'` - `1001'`). When the shortest branch (in this case the conflicting branch) reaches the 1003rd update, it gets is cut off. The revision tree is not in a corrupted state and the logic that chooses the winning revision still applies. But it may make it impossible to do certain merges (n-way merge) to resolve conflicts and will occupy disk space that could have been freed if the conflict was resolved early on.<br><br>

              ![](https://cl.ly/3C1G3t3R1v19/pruning-sg.gif)

              If the revision tree gets into this state then the only option to resolve the conflict is to pick a winning branch and tombstone all the non-winning conflicting branches.

              **NOTE:** Setting the `revs_limit` to a value below 100 when `allow_conflicts = true` may adversely affect the conflict resolution process, as there may be insufficient revision history to resolve a given conflict.

              The value of the *server* property specifies the Hostname(s) to the Couchbase Server node(s) in the cluster.

              Sync Gateway supports the ability to specify multiple hosts in the configuration.
              Sync Gateway supports both the `couchbase://` and `http://` schemes for specifying connection endpoints.

              Sync Gateway also supports *SSL* in the connection to Couchbase Server; use the `couchbases://` scheme for this.
              As with the Couchbase Server SDKs, the `https://` scheme is **not** supported.

              Examples of valid `server` values for *IPv4* include:
              - `couchbase://host1`
              - `couchbases://host1`
              - `couchbase://host1,host2`
              - `couchbase://host1:11210,host2,`
              - `couchbases://host1:11207,host2`
              - `http://host1:8091`
              - `http://host1,host2:8091`
              - `http://foo:bar@host1:8091`

              Examples of valid `server` values for *IPv6* include:
              - `http://[2001:db8::8811]:8091` *// single node IPv6 - http scheme with default server port*
              - `couchbases://[2001:db8::8811]` *// single node SSL IPv6 - default port (ommitted)*
              - `couchbase://[2001:db8::8811],[2001:db8::8822]:888` *// node1 default port, node2 port 888*

              As with the SDK, when using the `couchbase://` or `couchbases://` schemes, the port is not required, but if specified should be the external/internal bucket ports (defaults are 11210 or 11207 respectively). Attempting to use the admin ports (8091/18091) will result in a startup error.

              On startup, Sync Gateway will try each hostname that is provided until it is able to connect successfully.

              If the connection to Couchbase Server is lost during normal operations, Sync Gateway will automatically re-connect to another node in the cluster. During that re-connection period, the Sync Gateway will appear [offline](database-offline.html) and documents will not be replicated to mobile clients.

              The default value is an in-memory bucket called **walrus** that is only used during development and prototyping.
              Note that the **walrus** mode is being deprecated in Sync Gateway 2.5 and will be removed in a future release.

This configuration property is primarly used for web applications interacting with multiple Sync Gateway **databases**. Browsers typically have two methods of determining which cookie to use for a given request: the `URL` path or cookie name. With this property, you can use different cookie names for each database specified in the configuration file. Let's consider the following configuration file:

              ```json
              {
                 "interface":":4984",
                 "log":["*"],
                 "databases": {
                    "db1": {
                      "session_cookie_name": "CustomName1",
                      "server": "http://localhost:8091",
                      "bucket": "bucket-1",
                      "users": {
                          "user_1": {"password":"1234"}
                      },
                      "db2": {
                        "session_cookie_name": "CustomName2",
                        "server": "http://localhost:8091",
                        "bucket": "bucket-2",
                        "users": {
                            "adam_2": {"password":"5678"}
                        }
                      }
                    }
                 }
              }
              ```

              With this configuration, the `Set-Cookie` response header of the POST `:4984/{db}/_session` endpoint (Public REST API) would then have the form "CustomName1=3cad4b95524179bf144fe0d92b8f09877bb86bf5;path=/db1/".

              When using POST `:4985/{db}/_session` (Admin REST API) to create a session, the cookie value is returned in the response body instead of the `Set-Cookie` header. In this case, it could also be set by the client, for web applications it would be the following in JavaScript:

              ```javascript
              cookie1String = "CustomName1=3cad4b95524179bf144fe0d92b8f09877bb86bf5;path=/db1/";
              document.cookie = cookie1String;
              ```
            default: 'SyncGatewaySession'
          sync:
            type: string
            description: |
              The sync function is a JavaScript function whose source code is stored in the Sync Gateway's database configuration file. Every time a new document, revision or deletion is added to a database, the sync function is called and given a chance to examine the document (see the [Sync Function API guide](sync-function.html)).

              If a document is in conflict there will be multiple current revisions. The default, the "winning" one is the one whose channel assignments and access grants take effect.

              If you don't supply a sync function, Sync Gateway uses the following default sync function:

              ```javascript
              function (doc, oldDoc) {
                 channel(doc.channels);
              }
              ```

              In plain English: by default, a document will be assigned to the channels listed in its channels property (whose value must be a string or an array of strings.) More subtly, since there is no validation, any user can change any document. For this reason, the default sync function is really only useful for experimentation and development.

              The `channels` property is an array of strings that contains the names of the channels to which the document belongs.
              If you do not include a `channels` property in a document, the document does not appear in any channels.
              Adding a `channels` property to each document is the easiest way to map documents to channels but if you need more advanced behavior such as read and write access, you'll probably need to write your own Sync Function.
            default: function(doc, oldDoc) {channel(doc.channels);}

      - Access: Anytime an access() call is made in the sync function.
      - Attach: Attachment processing.
      - Auth: Authentication.
      - Bucket: Sync Gateway interactions with the bucket (verbose logging).
