                                description: HeapAlloc is bytes of allocated heap objects. Allocated heap objects include all reachable objects, as well as unreachable objects that the garbage collector has not yet freed. Specifically, HeapAlloc increases as heap objects are allocated and decreases as the heap is swept and unreachable objects are freed. Sweeping occurs incrementally between GC cycles, so these two processes occur simultaneously, and as a result HeapAlloc tends to change smoothly (in contrast with the sawtooth that is typical of stop-the-world garbage collectors).

These spans could be (and may already have been) returned to the OS, or they can be reused for heap allocations, or they can be reused as stack memory. HeapIdle minus HeapReleased estimates the amount of memory that could be returned to the OS, but is being retained by the runtime so it can grow the heap without requesting more memory from the OS. If this difference is significantly larger than the heap size, it indicates there was a recent transient spike in live heap size.
                              go_memstats_heapinuse:
                                type: integer

HeapInuse minus HeapAlloc estimates the amount of memory that has been dedicated to particular size classes, but is not currently being used. This is an upper bound on fragmentation, but in general this memory can be reused efficiently.

There is no StackIdle because unused stack spans are returned to the heap (and hence counted toward HeapIdle).

Sys measures the virtual address space reserved by the Go runtime for the heap, stacks, and other internal data structures. It's likely that not all of the virtual address space is backed by physical memory at any given moment, though in general it all was at some point.

                                      This is not necessarily the number of documents pushed, as a given target might already have the change.
