        To remove an attachment from a document, simply update the `_attachments` dictionary of the document in the PUT `/{db}/{id}` request. From then on, the attachment will not be replicated but will still reside in the Couchbase Server bucket (see open ticket [#1648](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/issues/1648)).

        This request adds or updates the supplied request content as an attachment to the specified document, the maximum content size of an attachment is 20MB. The attachment name must be a URL-encoded string (the file name). You must also supply either the rev query parameter or the If-Match HTTP header for validation, and the Content-Type headers (to set the attachment content type).

          When uploading an attachment using an existing attachment name, the corresponding stored content of the database will be updated. Because you must supply the revision information to add an attachment to the document, this serves as validation to update the existing attachment.

          Uploading an attachment updates the corresponding document revision. Revisions are tracked for the parent document, not individual attachments.

          To remove an attachment from a document, simply update the `_attachments` dictionary of the document in the PUT `/{db}/{id}` request. From then on, the attachment will not be replicated but will still reside in the Couchbase Server bucket (see open ticket [#1648](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/issues/1648)).

        This request enables you to add, update, or delete multiple documents to a database in a single request. To add new documents, you can either specify the ID (`_id`) or let the software create an ID. To update existing documents, you must provide the document ID, revision identifier (`_rev`), and new document values. To delete existing documents you must provide the document ID, revision identifier, and the deletion flag (`_deleted`).

        The JSON returned by the `_bulk_docs` operation consists of an array of JSON structures, one for each document in the original submission. The returned JSON structure should be examined to ensure that all of the documents submitted in the original request were successfully added to the database.

        This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.
        Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their X-Doc-ID and X-Rev-ID headers.
        A body for a document with no attachments will have content type application/json and contain the document itself.
        A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested multipart/related body. Its first part will be the document's JSON, and the subsequent parts will be the attachments (each identified by a Content-Disposition header giving its attachment name.)
      produces:
      - 'multipart/mixed'

      summary: Create or update document
      description: |
        This request creates a new document or creates a new revision of an existing document. It enables you to specify the identifier for a new document rather than letting the software create an identifier. If you want to create a new document and let the software create an identifier, use the POST /db request.
        If the document specified by doc does not exist, a new document is created and assigned the identifier specified in doc. If the document already exists, the document is updated with the JSON document in the message body and given a new revision. The maximum size allowed for a document is 20MB.

        Since Sync Gateway 1.3, an expiry property (`_exp`) can also be specified to purge the document after a given time. If **convergence** is enabled (introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5), the behaviour of the expiry feature changes in the following way: when the expiry value is reached, instead of getting purged, the **active** revision of the document is tombstoned. If there is another non-tombstoned revision for this document (i.e a conflict) it will become the active revision. The tombstoned revision will be purged when the server's metadata purge interval is reached.

        This request creates a database.

        You can optionally pass the database config as the JSON body. For example:

          {
            "server":"http://localhost:8091",
            "bucket": "todo_app",
            "users": {
              "john": {"password": "pass", "admin_channels": ["*"]}
            }
          }

        Note that if you pass the entire config file it won't work, it must be the database portion only (the database name is specified in the URL path). If the parameters passed are invalid it will create a walrus-backed database with all values set to default.

        By default, the database that is created is brought online immediately. To create the database and keep it offline, include the configuration property `offline` with the value `true` in the database configuration properties for the database that you are posting in the request body.

      summary: Compact the database
      description: |
        Triggers a compaction process. When a document is updated, Sync Gateway makes a copy of the previous revision body, for use by any in-flight replications. The primary motivation for using compaction is to reclaim disk space by deleting the JSON bodies of non-leaf revisions. As shown on the diagram below, after compaction, only properties with a leading underscore on the leaf revision (`_`) are kept to construct the revision tree.

          ![](https://cl.ly/1Q1F0i3f2i3n/compaction.gif)

        There are subtle differences in the way the `/{db}/_compact` endpoint works across Sync Gateway versions:

        **In Sync Gateway 1.2**, these obsolete revision bodies have to be cleaned up by calling the `/{db}/_compact` endpoint.

        In **1.3** and **1.4**, the parent revision is marked with a 5 minute expiry time, thus calling the `/{db}/_compact` endpoint is not necessary.

        In **1.5** with **shared bucket access** enabled, this endpoint can be used to compact Sync Gateway view indexes. When a Sync Gateway tombstone is purged from the database (based on the metadata purge interval), the document itself is purged, but its entry in the view index is not removed. The `/{db}/_compact` endpoint removes the index entries for purged tombstones from the Sync Gateway view indexes.

        The compaction process does not remove JSON bodies of leaf nodes (conflicting branches). Hence, it is also important to resolve conflicts in your application in order to re-claim disk space.

      summary: This request takes the specified database offline.
      description: |
        An offline database is not accessible through Sync Gateway's Public REST API. However, some commands can be given to Sync Gateway through the Admin REST API.

        Taking a database offline will:

        - Cleanly closes all active `_changes` feeds for this database.
        - Rejects all access to the database through the Public REST API (503 Service Unavailable).
        - Rejects most Admin API requests (503 Service Unavailable). A specific, short list of Admin REST API requests remain available (`GET /{db}`, `PUT /{db}/_config`, `POST /{db}/_resync`).
        - Stops webhook event handlers.
        - Does not take the backing Couchbase Server bucket offline. The bucket remains available and Sync Gateway keeps its connection to the bucket.

        When a database is offline, you can load configuration properties for the database, without stopping and re-starting the Sync Gateway instance. The new configuration properties are applied when the database is brought online.

        Taking a database offline that is in the progress of coming online will take the database offline after it comes online.

        For more information about taking a database offline and bringing it back online, see [this guide](../../../guides/sync-gateway/database-offline/index.html).

      description: |
        When a database is online, Sync Gateway serves both Public and Admin REST API requests for the database. This request brings the specified database online, either immediately or after a specified delay.

        Bringing a database online:

        - Closes the datbases connection to the backing Couchbase Server bucket.
        - Reloads the databse configuration, and connects to the backing Cocuhbase Server bucket.
        - Re-establishes access to the database from the Public REST API.
        - Accepts all Admin API requests.

        You can bring an offline database online after a specific delay. Uses for this include:

        - Making a database available for Couchbase Mobile clients at a specific time.
        - Making databases on several Sync Gateway instances available at the same time.

        For more information about taking a database offline and bringing it back online, see [this guide](../../../guides/sync-gateway/database-offline/index.html).

      summary: Purge document
      description: |
        The purge command provides a way to remove a document from the bucket itself. The operation removes all the revisions (active and tombstones) for the specified document(s). A common usage of this endpoint is to remove tombstone documents that are no longer needed, thus recovering storage space and reducing data replicated to clients. Other clients are not notified when a revision has been purged; so in order to purge a revision from the system it must be done from all databases (on Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway).

        When **convergence** is enabled (introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5), this endpoint removes the document and its associated extended attributes.

      summary: Reprocess all documents by the database in the sync function.
      description: |
        This request causes all documents to be reprocessed by the database sync function. The _resync operation should be called if the sync function for a databse has been modified in such a way that the channel or access mappings for any existing document would change as a result.

        When the sync function is invoked by _resync, the requireUser() and requireRole() calls will always return 'true'.

        A _resync operation on a database that is not in the offline state will be rejected (503 Service Unavailable).

        A _resync operation will block until all documents in the database have been processed.

      _exp:

        description: |
          Expiry time after which the document will be purged. The expiration time is set and managed on the Couchbase Server document (TTL is not supported for databases in walrus mode). The value can be specified in two ways; in ISO-8601 format, for example the 6th of July 2016 at 17:00 in the BST timezone would be 2016-07-06T17:00:00+01:00; it can also be specified as a numeric Couchbase Server expiry value. Couchbase Server expiries are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of GET /{db}/{doc} when show_exp=true is included in the querystring.

          As with the existing explicit purge mechanism, this applies only to the local database; it has nothing to do with replication. This expiration time is not propagated when the document is replicated. The purge of the document does not cause it to be deleted on any other database.
