          Expiry time after which the document will be purged. The expiration time is set and managed on the Couchbase Server document (TTL is not supported for databases in walrus mode). The value can be specified in two ways; in ISO-8601 format, for example the 6th of July 2016 at 17:00 in the BST timezone would be 2016-07-06T17:00:00+01:00; it can also be specified as a numeric Couchbase Server expiry value. Couchbase Server expiries are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of GET /{db}/{doc} when show_exp=true is included in the querystring.

          As with the existing explicit purge mechanism, this applies only to the local database; it has nothing to do with replication. This expiration time is not propagated when the document is replicated. The purge of the document does not cause it to be deleted on any other database.

        **About**

        The `_replication` endpoint** is used to manage both ad hoc (`adhoc=true`) and persistent replications.

        You can cancel continuous replications by adding the `cancel` parameter to the JSON request object and setting the value to true.
        Note that the structure of the request must be identical to the original for the cancellation request to be honoured.
        This means that for a `continuous` replication, the cancellation request must also contain the `continuous` setting, since the default value is `false`.

            description: |+
              **About**

              The **`conflict_resolution_type`** property specifies the conflict resolution policy Sync Gateway will apply when resolving conflicting revisions.

              The default behavior is that automatic conflict resolution policy is applied.

              **Valid options**
                - `default`
                - `localWins`
                - `remoteWins`
                - `custom`

              **Behavior**

              - *default* -- Selecting `default` applies the following conflict resolution policy
                - Deletes always win (the delete with longest revision history wins if both revisions are deletes)
                - The revision with the longest revision history wins (so, the one with most changes and consequently the highest revision Id).

              - *localWins* -- Selecting `localWins` will result in local revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
              - *remoteWins* -- Selecting `remoteWins` will result in remote revisions always being the winner in any conflict.


              - *custom* -- Selecting `custom` specifies that you want to handle conflict resolution with your own application logic. You **must** provide this logic as a Javascript function by specifying it in using the custom-conflict-resolver parameter.

              **Example**
              ```
              "conflict_resolution_type":"remoteWins"
              ```

              **Constraints**

              - replications created prior to version 2.8 will default to `default`.


          continuous:
            type: boolean
            default: false
            description: |+
              **About**

              The `continuous` property specifies whether this replication runs in continuous, or single-shot, mode.

              **Behavior**

              - `continuous=true`-- In continuous mode, changes are immediately synced in accordance with the replication definition.
              - `continuous=false`-- Detected changes are synced in accordance with the replication definition. The replication ceases once all revisions are processed.

              **Constraints**

              - Optional for stops and removes

          custom_conflict_resolver:
            type: string
            default: none
            description: |+
              **About**

              The `custom_conflict_resolver` property specifies the Javascript function that will be used to resolve conflicts, if the custom conflict resolution type is specified in the `conflict_resolution_type`.

              **Options**

              The property is *mandatory* when `conflict_resolution_type=custom` and will be ignored in all other cases.

              **Using**

              Provide the required logic in a Javascript function, as a string within backticks (see also the description for the `sync` function`.

              The function takes one parameter `struct` representing the conflict and comprising
              - the document id
              - the local document
              - the remote document

              The function returns a document `struct` representing the winning revision.

              **Example**
              ```
              "custom_conflict_resolver":`
                function(conflict) {
                  console.log("full remoteDoc doc: "+JSON.stringify(conflict.RemoteDocument));
                return conflict.RemoteDocument;
              }`
              ```

              **Constraints**

              Using complex `custom_conflict_resolver` functions can noticeably degrade performance. Use a built-in resolver whenever possible.


          direction:
            type: string
            description: |+
              **About**

              The mandatory `direction` property indicates whether the replication is *push*, *pull* or *pushAndPull*.

              The property value is referenced by the **remote** property.

              **Constraints**

              Replications created prior to version 2.8 derive the *direction* from the source/target url of the replication.


          enable_delta_sync:
            type: boolean
            default: false
            description: |+
              **About**

              The `enable_delta_sync` property specifies whether delta sync is, or is not, used for the replication.

              **Options**

              To use delta sync or not.

              - `enable_delta_sync=true` -- the replication runs using delta sync
              - `enable_delta_sync=false` -- the replication runs without delta sync

              **Behavior**

              The impact of this property is dependent on the `delta_sync.enabled` setting for the relevent databases as indicated here.

              - **If** `"delta_sync.enabled": true` for both databases involved in the replication, then this parameter enables or disables its use for this specific replication.

              -  In all other cases it has no effect and the replication runs without delta-sync.

              **Constraints**

              - Requires *Enterprise Edition*
              - Replications created prior to version 2.8 run with `enable_delta_sync=false`


          filter:
            type: string
            description: |+
              **About**

              Use the optional `filter` property to defines the function to be used to filter documents.

              **Options**

              A common value used when replicating from Sync Gateway is `sync_gateway/bychannel`. This option limits the pull replication to a specific set of channels. You can specify the required channels using `query_params`.

              **Behavior**

              Works in conjunction with `query_params` to control the documents processed by the replication.

              **Example**

              ```
              "filter":"sync_gateway/bychannel"
              ```

              **Constraints**

              OPTIONAL for stops and removes (even if defined during creation)


          max_backoff_time:
            type: integer
            default: 5
            description: |+
              **About**

              The **max_backoff_time** property indicates the time-period (in minutes) during which Sync Gateway will attempt to reconnect lost or unreachable *remote* targets.

              On disconnection, Sync Gateway will do an exponential backoff up to the specified value, after which it will attempt to reconnect indefinitely every *max_backoff_time* minutes.

              If the value is zero, Sync Gateway will do an exponential backoff up to an interval of five minutes before stopping the replication.

              **Constrains**

              This value defaults to five minutes for replications created prior to version 2.8.

              **About**

              The optional `purge_on_removal` property specifies, per replication, whether the removal of a `channel` triggers a purge.

              **Options**
              - `true` or `false`
              - Default = false -- document removals are ignored by receiving end

              **Behavior**

              If `purge_on_removal=false`, then the removal of channels is ignored (not purged) by the receiving end.

              **Constraints**

              Replications created prior to version 2.8 *must* be run with `purge_on_removal=false`.


          query_params:
            type: array
            description: |+
              **About**

              The `query_params` property defines a set of key/value pairs used in the query string of the replication.

              **Behavior**

              This property works in conjunction with `filters` and `channels` to provide routing.

              **Using**

              You can use `query_params`' *channels* function to *pull* from a specific set of `channels`.
              To do so, you would also need to set the `filter` to  `sync_gateway/bychannels`.

              **Example**

              ```json
                "filter":"sync_gateway/bychannel",
                "query_params": {
                  "channels":["channel.user1"]
                },
              ```

              **Constraints**

              OPTIONAL for stops and removes (even if defined during creation)

            items:
              type: string


          remote:
            type: string
            description: |+
              **About**

              The **remote** property represents a database URL for the remote Sync Gateway.
              That is, it identifies the remote Sync Gateway database that is the subject of this replication's push, pull or pushAndPull action.

              **Behavior**

              Dependent upon setting of **direction**. If **direction** is :
              - *pull*, this is the cluster *from* which data is pulled
              - *push*, this is the cluster *to* which data is pushed
              - *pushAndPull*, this is the cluste from which data is pushed.

              **Example**

              ```
                "remote": "http://www.example.com:4984/db2name",
              ```

              **Constraints**

              - You must specify the 'remote' database's url even if it is located on the same cluster as the replication's database.
              - OPTIONAL for stops and removes


          replication_id:
            type: string
            description: |+
              **About**

              The *replication_id* property indicates the ID that Sync Gateway assigned to the replication.

              Sync Gateway assigns a random UUID if no `replication_id` is  specified when the replication is created.

          initial_state:
            type: string
            default: Running
            description: |+
              **About**

              The optional `initial_state` property is used to specify that the replication must be launched in 'Stopped' mode

              **Behavior**

              All replications are configured to start on Sync Gateway launch. So, if omitted, the state defaults to 'Running'.

              **Constraints*

              Replications created prior to version 2.8 will all default to a state of 'Running'.

          username:
            type: string
            default: Mandatory
            description: |+

                The `username` forms part of the credentials used to authenticate and approve access to data

                This field is redacted a string of '****' is displayed in its place.

  block-rep-cancel-text:
    description: |+
      You can cancel continuous replications by adding the cancel field to the JSON request object and setting the value to true.

      Note that the structure of the request must be identical to the original for the cancellation request to be honoured.

      For example, if you requested continuous replication, the cancellation request must also contain the continuous field.

          default: false
          description: |+
            **About**

            Use the Admin REST API's `adhoc` parameter to specify that a replication is ad hoc rather than persistent.

            **Behavior**

            Ad hoc replications behave the same as normal replications, but they are automatically removed when their status changes to stopped.
            This will usually be on completion, but may also be as a result of user action.

            **Constraints**

            This parameter is **NOT** available to configured replications; only those initialized using the Admin REST API.

          type: integer
          default: 200
          description: |+

          type: boolean
          default: false
          description: |+
            **About**

            Use this parameter on,y when you want to want to cancel an existing active replication.

            **Constraints**

            - This parameter is **NOT** available in configured replications; only those initialized using the Admin REST API.
            - **NOTE** that the body of the request must be the same as the replication's replication definition for the cancellation request to be honoured.
            For example, if you requested continuous replication, the cancellation request must also contain the continuous field.

        conflict_resolution_type:
          type: string
          default: default
          description: |+
            **About**

            The **`conflict_resolution_type`** property defines the conflict resolution policy that Sync Gateway applies when resolving conflicting revisions.

            The default behavior is that automatic conflict resolution policy is applied.

            **Valid options**
              - `default`
              - `localWins`
              - `remoteWins`
              - `custom`

            **Behavior**

            - *default* -- Selecting `default` applies the following conflict resolution policy
              - Deletes always win (the delete with longest revision history wins if both revisions are deletes)
              - The revision with the longest revision history wins (so, the one with most changes and consequently the highest revision Id).

            - *localWins* -- Selecting `localWins` will result in local revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
            - *remoteWins* -- Selecting `remoteWins` will result in remote revisions always being the winner in any conflict.


            - *custom* -- Selecting `custom` specifies that you want to handle conflict resolution with your own application logic. You **must** provide this logic as a Javascript function by specifying it in using the custom-conflict-resolver parameter.

            **Example**
            ```
            "conflict_resolution_type":"remoteWins"
            ```

            **Constraints**

            - replications created prior to version 2.8 will default to `default`.


        continuous:
          type: boolean
          default: false
          description: |+
            **About**

            The `continuous` property specifies whether this replication will run in continuous mode.

            **Behavior**

            - `continuous=true`-- In continuous mode, changes are immediately synced in accordance with the replication definition.
            - `continuous=false`-- Detected changes are synced in accordance with the replication definition. The replication ceases once all revisions are processed.

            **Constraints**

            - Optional for stops and removes

        custom_conflict_resolver:
          type: string
          default: none
          description: |+
            **About**

            The optional `custom_conflict_resolver` property specifies the Javascript function that will be used to resolve conflicts, if the custom conflict resolution type is specified in the `conflict_resolution_type`.

            **Options**

            The property is *mandatory* when `conflict_resolution_type=custom` and will be ignored in all other cases.

            **Using**

            Provide the required logic in a Javascript function, as a string within backticks (see also the description for the `sync` function`.

            The function takes one parameter `struct` representing the conflict and comprising
            - the document id
            - the local document
            - the remote document

            The function returns a document `struct` representing the winning revision.

            **Example**
            ```
            "custom_conflict_resolver":`
              function(conflict) {
                console.log("full remoteDoc doc: "+JSON.stringify(conflict.RemoteDocument));
              return conflict.RemoteDocument;
            }`
            ```

            **Constraints**

            Using complex `custom_conflict_resolver` functions can noticeably degrade performance. Use a built-in resolver whenever possible.

        direction:
          type: string
          description: |+
            **About**

            The mandatory `direction` property specifies whether the replication is *push*, *pull* or *pushAndPull* relative to this node.

            The property value is referenced by the [remote](rest-api-admin.html#database-this_db-replications-remote) property.

            **Behavior**

            - `pull` -- changes are pulled from the `remote` database
            - `push` -- changes are pushed to the `remote` database
            - `pushAndPull` -- changes are both pushed-to and pulled-from the `remote` database

            **Constraints**

            Replications created prior to version 2.8 derive their *direction* from the source/target url of the replication.

        enable_delta_sync:
          type: boolean
          default: false
          description: |+
            **About**

            The optional `enable_delta_sync` parameter turns on delta sync for a replication.
            It works in conjunction with the database level setting `delta_sync.enabled`.

            **Options**

            - `"enable_delta_sync": true`, the replication can use delta sync (depending on `delta_sync.enabled` setting)
            - `"enable_delta_sync": false`, the replication cannot use delta sync

            **Behavior**

            The optional `enable_delta_sync` parameter works in conjunction with the database level `delta_sync.enabled` setting, to determine whether this replication uses delta sync.

            - **If** `"delta_sync.enabled": true` for both databases involved in the replication, then this parameter enables or disables its use for this specific replication.
            -  In all other cases it has no effect and the replication runs without delta-sync.

            **Constraints**

            - Applies **ONLY** to Enterprise Edition deployments.
            - Depends upon the setting of the database level parameter `delta_sync.enabled`
            - Replications created prior to version 2.8 must run with `"enable_delta_sync": false`
            - Push replications will not use Delta Sync when pushing to a pre-2.8 target
        filter:
          type: string
          description: |+
            **About**

            Use the optional `filter`property to defines the function to be used to filter documents.

            **Options**

            A common value used when replicating from Sync Gateway is `sync_gateway/bychannel`. This option limits the pull replication to a specific set of channels. You can specify the required channels using `query_params`.

            **Behavior**

            Works in conjunction with `query_params` to control the documents processed by the replication.

            **Example**

            ```
            "filter":"sync_gateway/bychannel"
            ```

            **Constraints**

            OPTIONAL for stops and removes (even if defined during creation)


        max_backoff_time:
          type: integer
          default: 5
          description: |+
            The **max_backoff_time**property specifies the time-period (in minutes) during which Sync Gateway will attempt to reconnect lost or unreachable *remote* targets.

            On disconnection, Sync Gateway will do an exponential backoff up to the specified value, after which it will attempt to reconnect indefinitely every *max_backoff_time* minutes.

            If a zero value is specified, then Sync Gateway will do an exponential backoff up to an interval of five minutes before stopping the replication.

            NOTE -- this value defaults to five minutes for replications created prior to version 2.8.

        password:
          type: string
          default: mandatory
          description: |+
            **About**

              Use `password` to provide the login password value for the accredited user running this replication.

            **Behavior**

              These details are used to authenticate credentials and approve access to data.

              Once provided and recorded, the password data is redacted and will not be displayed in either the configuration file or Admin REST API. A string of `****` will be displayed in its place.

        perf_tuning_params:
          type: array
          description: |+
            The perf_tuning_params are not available in this release.

            NOTE -- This property replaces the 'changes_feed_limit' at version 2.8
          items:
            type: string

        purge_on_removal:
          type: boolean
          default: false
          description: |+
            **About**

            The optional `purge_on_removal` property specifies, per replication, whether the removal of a `channel` triggers a purge.

            **Options**
            - `true` or `false`
            - Default = false -- document removals are ignored by receiving end

            **Behavior**

            If `purge_on_removal=false`, then the removal of channels is ignored (not purged) by the receiving end.

            **Constraints**

            Replications created prior to version 2.8 *must* be run with `purge_on_removal=false`.

        query_params:
          type: array
          description: |+
            **About**

            The `query_params` property defines a set of key/value pairs used in the query string of the replication.

            **Behavior**

            This property works in conjunction with `filters` and `channels` to provide routing.

            **Using**

            You can use `query_params`' *channels* function to *pull* from a specific set of `channels`.
            To do so, you would also need to set the `filter` to  `sync_gateway/bychannels`.

            **Example**

            ```json
              "filter":"sync_gateway/bychannel",
              "query_params": {
                "channels":["channel.user1"]
              },
            ```

            **Constraints**

            OPTIONAL for stops and removes (even if defined during creation)

          items:
            type: string

        remote:
          type: string
          description: |+
            **About**

            The **remote** property represents the endpoint of s database for the remote Sync Gateway.
            That is, it identifies the remote Sync Gateway database that is the subject of this replication's push, pull or pushAndPull action.

            Typically the endpoint will include URI, Port and Database name elements.

            **Format**

            - a string containing a valid URL for a (remote) Sync Gateway database.
            - an object whose url property contains the Sync Gateway database URL.

            **Behavior**

              Dependent upon setting of **direction**.

              If **direction** is :
              - *pull*, 'remote' defines the remote cluster *from* which data is pulled
              - *push*, 'remote' defines the remote cluster *to* which data is pushed
              - *pushAndPull*, 'remote' defines the *push* configuration.

            **Example**

            ```json
            "remote": "http://www.example.com:4984/sample-database",
            ```

        replication_id:
          type: string
          description: |+
            **About**

            The *replication_id* property specifies either:
            - For NEW replications, the ID to be assigned to the the replication. If no *replication_id* is specified, Sync Gateway will assign a random UUID to new replications.
            - For existing replications, this is the ID of the required replication.
            - If **cancel=true**, this is the id of the active replication task to be cancelled.

            **Constraints**

            If this is specified in the body of a POST or PUT request then it must be the same value as specified in the request URL.


        initial_state:
          type: string
          default: Running
          description: |+
            **About**

            The optional `initial_state` property is used to specify that the replication must be launched in 'Stopped' mode

            **Behavior**

            All replications are configured to start on Sync Gateway launch. So, if omitted, the state defaults to 'Running'.

            **Constraints*

            Replications created prior to version 2.8 will all default to a state of 'Running'.

        username:
          type: string
          default: Mandatory
          description: |+
            **About**

            Use `username` to provide the name of the accredited user running this replication.

            **Behavior**

            These details are used to authenticate credentials and approve access to data

            Once provided and recorded, the username data is redacted and will not be displayed in either the configuration file or Admin REST API. A string of `****` will be displayed in its place.
