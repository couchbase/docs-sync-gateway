            This object comprises the stats collected and recorded for the inter-sync-gateway replication named $replname (which equates to a `replication_id`).
            The same structure is used to return statistics from inter-sync-gateway replications versions 1 and 2, but not all items are populated by each version.
          properties:
            sgr_active:
              type: boolean
              description: |+
                Whether the replication is active at this time.
                **Deprecated @ 2.8**: used only by inter-sync-gateway replications version 1.

            sgr_docs_checked_sent:
                type: integer
                description: |+
                  The total number of documents checked for changes since replication started.
                  This represents the number of potential change notifications pushed by Sync Gateway.

                  **Constraints**
                  - This is not necessarily the number of documents pushed, as a given target might already have the change.
                  - Used by versions 1 and 2.

                type: integer
                description: |+
                  The total number of attachment bytes transferred since replication started.
                  **Deprecated @ 2.8**: used only by inter-sync-gateway replications version 1.
