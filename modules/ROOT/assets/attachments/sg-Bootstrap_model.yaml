      server:
        type: string
        default: none
        description: 'Sets the endpoint for the Couchbase Server holding (database)
          configuration details.


          The value of the *server* property specifies the Hostname(s) to the Couchbase
          Server node(s) in the cluster.


          Sync Gateway supports the ability to specify multiple hosts in the configuration.

          Sync Gateway supports both the `couchbase://` and `http://` schemes for
          specifying connection endpoints.


          Sync Gateway also supports *SSL* in the connection to Couchbase Server;
          use the `couchbases://` scheme for this.

          As with the Couchbase Server SDKs, the `https://` scheme is **not** supported.


          Examples of valid `server` values for *IPv4* include:

          - `couchbase://host1`

          - `couchbases://host1`

          - `couchbase://host1,host2`

          - `couchbase://host1:11210,host2,`

          - `couchbases://host1:11207,host2`

          - `http://host1:8091`

          - `http://host1,host2:8091`

          - `http://foo:bar@host1:8091`


          Examples of valid `server` values for *IPv6* include:

          - `http://[2001:db8::8811]:8091` *// single node IPv6 - http scheme with
          default server port*

          - `couchbases://[2001:db8::8811]` *// single node SSL IPv6 - default port
          (omitted)*

          - `couchbase://[2001:db8::8811],[2001:db8::8822]:888` *// node1 default
          port, node2 port 888*


          As with the SDK, when using the `couchbase://` or `couchbases://` schemes,
          the port is not required, but if specified should be the external/internal
          bucket ports (defaults are 11210 or 11207 respectively). Attempting to use
          the admin ports (8091/18091) will result in a startup error.


          **Alternate Addresses**


          On startup, Sync Gateway will try each hostname that is provided until it
          is able to connect successfully.


          By default, if a remote cluster has an external address set, then when SG
          connects it will apply a heuristic to determine whether to choose between
          external or default (internal) addresses.


          The choice is based on the host names supplied in the connection string.

          - SG uses external networking only when none of the supplied host names
          match any of Couchbase Server''s internal node addresses, and an external
          address is defined.

          - In all other cases Sync Gateway uses the default (internal) networking.


          However, it is possible to override this behavior by adding a `network`
          parameter to the connection string.


          The `network` parameter can be --

          - auto - this is the default value if no parameter is provided. In this
          case the heuristic described above is applied to determine the address used;
          so effectively there is no override.

          - external - to always force use of the external address

          - default - to always force use of the internal address


          For example:

          ```"server": "couchbases://my-cbs-server?network=default"```


          Will force the connection to ignore any alternative external addresses configured
          on the Couchbase Server node.


          **Lost Connections**


          If the connection to Couchbase Server is lost during normal operations,
          Sync Gateway will automatically re-connect to another node in the cluster.
          During that re-connection period, the Sync Gateway will appear offline -
          see [Taking Databases Offline](database-offline.html) - and documents will
          not be replicated to mobile clients.
