            description: |+
              Introduced in Sync Gateway 2.0, this property can be used to disable Sync Gateway's handling of conflicts.

              Setting to `false` will cause Sync Gateway to reject any attempt to write conflicting revisions (returning a `409` HTTP status code). It will be up to the client to resolve the conflict. Restarting Sync Gateway with this property enabled will not automatically result in disk space savings (compaction on a document won't occur until a document is updated).

              *Constraints:*
              - Push replications to pre-2.8 targets do not support the `"allow_conflicts": false` setting; the target must use `"allow_conflicts": true`.

          delta_sync:
            type: object
            description: |+
              NOTE: Delta Sync is an Enterprise Edition feature on Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite.

              Delta Sync is the ability to replicate only parts of the Couchbase mobile document that have changed. This can result in significant savings in bandwidth consumption as well as throughput improvements, especially when network bandwidth is typically constrained.

              Delta Sync incurs additional bucket storage requirements which can be tuned with the [`rev_max_age_seconds`](#databases-this_db-delta_sync-rev_max_age_seconds) property.

              Delta Sync does not apply to attachment contents.

              Delta Sync is disabled by default on the Sync Gateway. You can enable it through the `enabled` property.

              If delta sync is enabled on Sync Gateway, then Couchbase Lite clients will switch to using delta sync automatically.
              Similarly, if delta sync is disabled on Sync Gateway, clients will switch to normal mode.

              *Note:* Push replications do not use Delta Sync when pushing to a pre-2.8 target.

              The following configuration example enables delta sync.

              ```javascript
              {
                "logging": {
                  "console": {
                    "log_keys": ["*"]
                  }
                },
                "databases": {
                  "db": {
                    "server": "http://localhost:8091",
                    "bucket": "default",
                    "users": { "GUEST": { "disabled": false, "admin_channels": ["*"] } },
                    "allow_conflicts": false,
                    "revs_limit": 20,
                    "delta_sync": {
                      "enabled": true,
                      "rev_max_age_seconds": 86400
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
              ```

              Footnotes:

              - Delta Sync is automatically enabled for peer-to-peer sync between Couchbase Lite clients.
              - Delta sync is disabled for Couchbase Lite database replicas.

              rev_max_age_seconds:
                type: integer
                description: |+
                  On a write operation, the revision body is backed up in the bucket and retained for `rev_max_age_seconds` to calculate future revision deltas.
                  As a result, new deltas can only be generated for read requests that come in within the `rev_max_age_seconds` time window.
                  The storage of backed up revision bodies for delta sync incurs additional bucket storage requirements.

                  The additional storage can be calculated with the following formula: `(doc_size * updates_per_day * 86400) / rev_max_age_seconds`.

                  For example, with `rev_max_age_seconds`'s default value, an average document size of 4 KB and 100 writes/day, enabling delta sync would take up an additional 400 KB of storage on Couchbase Server (`(4 * 100 * 86400)/86400`).

                  Setting this value to 0 will generate deltas opportunistically on pull replications, with no additional storage requirements.

          import_docs:
            type: boolean
            description: |+
              Introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5, this property specifies whether this Sync Gateway node should perform import processing.

              This property works in conjunction with the [enable_shared_bucket_access](#databases-this_db-enable_shared_bucket_access) property.

              Starting in Sync Gateway 2.7, all Sync Gateway nodes can be configured as import nodes. This results in performance benefits as the import process is shared across all Sync Gateway nodes.

              Prior to version 2.7, `import_docs` can only be set to `true` on a single node.

              #### Workload Isolation

              Starting in version 2.7, if `enable_shared_bucket_access` is set to `true` and `import_docs` is set to `false`, the node will not be participating in the import process.

              This configuration is specifically recommended for workload isolation: to isolate import nodes from the client-facing nodes. Workload isolation is preferable in deployments with a large write throughput.

              Prior to Release 2.1 a value of 'continuous' was also allowed. This was deprecated at Release 2.1 and replaced with the boolean value True. There is no change to the behavior or functionality (that is, a value of 'continuous' was interpreted as True and had the same effect).

              Allows users to tune the number of partitions used for import processing. Partitions are distributed among all Sync Gateway nodes participating in import processing (import_docs:true), and each process a subset of the server's vbuckets.

              Each partition is processed by a separate goroutine, so import_partitions can be used to tune concurrency based on the number of Sync Gateway nodes, and the number of cores per node.

                    description: |+
                      Tuning this property is an [Enterprise Edition](https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions) feature.
                      The Community Edition is configured with the default value, and will ignore any value in the configuration file.

                      Maximum number of channel caches which will exist at any one point. This property is used to determine the cache size (and the associated eviction watermarks `compact_low_watermark_pct`/`compact_high_watermark_pct`).

                      The default value for this property is 50000. Along with the default channel `min_length` and `max_length` values, this would result in a memory usage under 1GB.

                      The `max_number` value can be tuned to optimize for cache hits (requests that are handled using the cache), as opposed to cache misses (requests that require a round-trip to Couchbase Server to fetch data). The cache hit/miss ratio can be obtained with the following:

                      cache hit/miss ratio = `cache.chan_cache_hits` / `cache.chan_cache_misses`

                      Increasing the `max_number` value can increase the cache hit/miss ratio, resulting in better cache utilization.

                      If the cache size grows to reach the high watermark (`compact_high_watermark_pct`), channels with no connected replications will be evicted before channels which are associated with an active pull replication (i.e a blip-based pull replication in Couchbase Lite 2.x, or an active `/{db}/_changes` request in Couchbase Lite 1.x).

                      The minimum allowed value is 100.

                      It isn't possible to remove the limit altogether, users who wish to remove the limit would need to set `max_number` to an arbitrarily high value.

                      ##### Disabling the revision cache

                      Disabling the revision cache is an [Enterprise Edition](https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions) feature.

                      To disable the revision entirely, set this property to 0. Setting this property to 0 on the Community Edition is ignored.

                      Disabling the revision cache would be useful when there are very large documents or if you expect a very low cache hit rate. Otherwise it could negatively impact the latency of replications. It is generally not recommended to disable the revision cache, unless advised by Couchbase [Enterprise Support](https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy).

                      Tuning this property is an [Enterprise Edition](https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions) feature.
                      The Community Edition is configured with the default value, and will ignore any value in the configuration file.

                      Number of shards the rev cache should be split into. More shards allows for lower cache contention when accessing distinct revisions, at the cost of some memory overhead per-shard. This generally should not greatly exceed the number of CPU threads available to Sync Gateway.

                      It is generally not recommended to set this property, unless advised by Couchbase [Enterprise Support](https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy).

          enable_shared_bucket_access:
            type: boolean
            description: |+
              Introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5, this property specifies whether to enable Mobile-Server Data Sync (a.k.a _mobile convergence_). You can learn more about this functionality in [Syncing Mobile and Server](shared-bucket-access.html)

              This property works in conjunction with the [import_docs](#databases-this_db-import_docs) property, which determines whether a node participates in import processing.

              Set `enable_shared_bucket_access` to `true` on all nodes participating in such a configuration.

              On start-up, Sync Gateway will generate the mobile-specific metadata for all the pre-existing documents in the Couchbase Server bucket. From then on, documents can be inserted on the Server directly (with N1QL or SDKs) or through the Sync Gateway REST API.

              #### Tombstones

              When `enable_shared_bucket_access` is enabled, mobile tombstones are now also server tombstones. The document body is deleted, and only the mobile sync metadata required to replicate the tombstone is retained in the mobile extended attribute.

              The server's metadata purge interval becomes an important consideration for mobile deployments under convergence. When the server purges a tombstone (based on the metadata purge interval), that tombstone will no longer be replicated to mobile clients.

              Users should set the server's metadata purge interval based on their expected client replication frequency, to ensure that clients are notified of the tombstone prior to that tombstone being purged.

              NOTE: The default Metadata Purge Interval is set to 3 days which can potentially result in tombstones being purged before all clients have had a chance to get notified of it.

              Ways to tune the Metadata Purge Interval on Couchbase Server:

              - Bucket settings [on UI](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.html)
              - Bucket endpoint [on the REST API](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-bucket-create.html)

              #### Implementation notes for XATTRs:

              Mobile applications require additional metadata in order to manage security and replication. In previous versions of Sync Gateway, this information has always been stored in the document body. Sync Gateway 1.5 utilizes a new feature of Couchbase Server 5.0 called XATTRs (x-attributes) to store that metadata into an external document fragment.

              Extended attributes (xattrs) are JSON objects that can be associated with Couchbase documents. Each document can be associated with zero or more extended attributes. There are currently three types (user, system, virtual). Mobile Convergence uses a system extended attribute, which has the following characteristics central to convergence:

               - Shares lifetime with the document metadata - when a document is deleted, system xattrs are preserved with the tombstone.
               - Allocated 1MB of storage, independent of the 20MB available for the document

              Extended attributes are stored as part of the document, and are replicated with the document (both intra-cluster replication and XDCR).

              Extended attributes can be accessed via the SDKs using the sub-document API, via command-line tools, and via views.

              They are also accessible from N1QL in Couchbase Server 5.5 or above with the `().xattrs` property. For example, `SELECT meta().xattrs._sync from travel-sample where Meta().id = "user::demo";`.

              **WARNING:** The sync metadata is maintained internally by Sync Gateway and its structure can change at any time. It should not be used to drive business logic of applications. The direct use of the N1QL query is unsupported and must not be used in production environments.
              The `raw` endpoint ([/db/_raw/{docid}](rest-api-admin.html#/Document/get__db___raw__doc_)) on Sync Gateway's Admin REST API returns both the document and it's associated mobile metadata.

          event_handlers:
            type: object
            description: Webhooks in Sync Gateway are designed to minimize performance impacts on Sync Gateway's regular processing. Sync Gateway manages the number of processes that are spawned for webhook event handling, so that slow response times from the HTTP POST operations don't consume available CPU resources on Sync Gateway nodes. When a `webhook` event handler is defined, after Sync Gateway has updated a document, Sync Gateway adds a `document_changed` event to an asynchronous event-processing queue (the event queue). New processes are then spawned to apply the `filter` function to the documents and to perform the HTTP POST operations. When an event is not added to the event queue, but is instead discarded, a warning message is written to the the Sync Gateway log. You can configure Sync Gateway to log information about event handling, by including either the log key `Event` or `Events+` in the `Log` property in your Sync Gateway configuration file. `Events+` is more verbose.

              You should provision the filter as a Javascript function in the request body of a call to the Admin Rest API endpoint ```put {db}/_config/import_filter```.

              Set the header's content type to ```content-Type: application/javascript```.

              The function takes the document body as parameter and is expected to return a boolean to indicate whether the document should be imported.

                            The specified claim must be a string, as numeric claims may be un-marshalled inconsistently between Sync Gateway and the underlying OIDC library.

                            Subject is always the sub claim in the token.

                            Behaviour:

                            - If username_claim is set but user_prefix is not set, use that claim as the Sync Gateway username.

          revs_limit:

            description: |+
              This property defines the maximum depth to which a document's revision tree can grow; its value governs the point at which to prune a document's revision tree.

              The default and minimum values of `revs_limit` are dependent on whether [allow_conflicts](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-allow_conflicts) is set True or False -- see the *Default and Minimum Values* table below.

              The process to remove obsolete revisions is called pruning and runs automatically every time a revision is added. Although fundamentally the same, the pruning algorithm works slightly differently between Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite. On Sync Gateway, the pruning algorithm is applied to the shortest, non-tombstoned branch in the revision tree.

              If there are conflicting revisions, the document may end up with **disconnected branches** after the pruning process. In the animation below, the document has a conflicting branch (revisions `4'` - `1001'`). When the shortest branch (in this case the conflicting branch) reaches the 1003rd update, it gets is cut off. The revision tree is not in a corrupted state and the logic that chooses the winning revision still applies. But it may make it impossible to do certain merges (n-way merge) to resolve conflicts and will occupy disk space that could have been freed if the conflict was resolved early on.<br><br>

              ![](https://cl.ly/3C1G3t3R1v19/pruning-sg.gif)

              If the revision tree gets into this state then the only option to resolve the conflict is to pick a winning branch and tombstone all the non-winning conflicting branches.

              **NOTE:** Setting the `revs_limit` to a value below 100 when `allow_conflicts = true` may adversely affect the conflict resolution process, as there may be insufficient revision history to resolve a given conflict.

            description: |+
              The value of the *server* property specifies the Hostname(s) to the Couchbase Server node(s) in the cluster.

              Sync Gateway supports the ability to specify multiple hosts in the configuration.
              Sync Gateway supports both the `couchbase://` and `http://` schemes for specifying connection endpoints.

              Sync Gateway also supports *SSL* in the connection to Couchbase Server; use the `couchbases://` scheme for this.
              As with the Couchbase Server SDKs, the `https://` scheme is **not** supported.

              Examples of valid `server` values for *IPv4* include:
              - `couchbase://host1`
              - `couchbases://host1`
              - `couchbase://host1,host2`
              - `couchbase://host1:11210,host2,`
              - `couchbases://host1:11207,host2`
              - `http://host1:8091`
              - `http://host1,host2:8091`
              - `http://foo:bar@host1:8091`

              Examples of valid `server` values for *IPv6* include:
              - `http://[2001:db8::8811]:8091` *// single node IPv6 - http scheme with default server port*
              - `couchbases://[2001:db8::8811]` *// single node SSL IPv6 - default port (omitted)*
              - `couchbase://[2001:db8::8811],[2001:db8::8822]:888` *// node1 default port, node2 port 888*

              As with the SDK, when using the `couchbase://` or `couchbases://` schemes, the port is not required, but if specified should be the external/internal bucket ports (defaults are 11210 or 11207 respectively). Attempting to use the admin ports (8091/18091) will result in a startup error.

              **Alternate Addresses**

              On startup, Sync Gateway will try each hostname that is provided until it is able to connect successfully.

              By default, if a remote cluster has an external address set, then when SG connects it will apply a heuristic to determine whether to choose between external or default (internal) addresses.

              The choice is based on the host names supplied in the connection string.
              - SG uses external networking only when none of the supplied host names match any of Couchbase Server's internal node addresses, and an external address is defined.
              - In all other cases Sync Gateway uses the default (internal) networking.

              However, it is possible to override this behavior by adding a `network` parameter to the connection string.

              The `network` parameter can be --
              - auto -- this is the default value if no parameter is provided. In this case the heuristic described above is applied to determine the address used; so effectively there is no override.
              - external -- to always force use of the external address
              - default -- to always force use of the internal address

              For example:
              ```"server": "couchbases://my-cbs-server?network=default"```

              Will force the connection to ignore any alternative external addresses configured on the Couchbase Server node.

              **Lost Connections**

              If the connection to Couchbase Server is lost during normal operations, Sync Gateway will automatically re-connect to another node in the cluster. During that re-connection period, the Sync Gateway will appear offline -- see [Taking Databases Offline](database-offline.html) -- and documents will not be replicated to mobile clients.

              The default value is an in-memory bucket called **walrus** that is only used during development and prototyping.
              Note that the **walrus** mode is being deprecated in Sync Gateway 2.5 and will be removed in a future release.
            default: 'walrus:'

            description: |+
              Starting in Sync Gateway 2.0, it is possible to customize the session cookie name that is used for this database. This configuration property is primarly used for web applications interacting with multiple Sync Gateway **databases**. Browsers typically have two methods of determining which cookie to use for a given request: the `URL` path or cookie name. With this property, you can use different cookie names for each database specified in the configuration file. Let's consider the following configuration file:

              ```json
              {
                 "interface":":4984",
                 "log":["*"],
                 "databases": {
                    "db1": {
                      "session_cookie_name": "CustomName1",
                      "server": "http://localhost:8091",
                      "bucket": "bucket-1",
                      "db2": {
                        "session_cookie_name": "CustomName2",
                        "server": "http://localhost:8091",
                        "bucket": "bucket-2"
                      }
                    }
                 }
              }
              ```

              With this configuration, the `Set-Cookie` response header of the POST `:4984/{db}/_session` endpoint (Public REST API) would then have the form "CustomName1=3cad4b95524179bf144fe0d92b8f09877bb86bf5;path=/db1/".

              When using POST `:4985/{db}/_session` (Admin REST API) to create a session, the cookie value is returned in the response body instead of the `Set-Cookie` header. In this case, it could also be set by the client, for web applications it would be the following in JavaScript:

              ```javascript
              cookie1String = "CustomName1=3cad4b95524179bf144fe0d92b8f09877bb86bf5;path=/db1/";
              document.cookie = cookie1String;

          sync:
            type: string
            description: |+
              The sync function is a JavaScript function whose source code is stored in the Sync Gateway's database configuration file. Every time a new document, revision or deletion is added to a database, the sync function is called and given a chance to examine the document (see the [Sync Function API guide](advance/adv-sgw-cfg-sync-function.html)).

              If a document is in conflict there will be multiple current revisions. The default, the "winning" one is the one whose channel assignments and access grants take effect.

              **As with all embedded functions in this configuration file, the Sync Function must be enclosed in a pair of backticks.**

              If you don't supply a sync function, Sync Gateway uses the following default sync function:

              ```javascript
              `function (doc, oldDoc) {
                 channel(doc.channels);
              }`
              ```

              In plain English: by default, a document will be assigned to the channels listed in its channels property (whose value must be a string or an array of strings.) More subtly, since there is no validation, any user can change any document. For this reason, the default sync function is really only useful for experimentation and development.

              The `channels` property is an array of strings that contains the names of the channels to which the document belongs.
              If you do not include a `channels` property in a document, the document does not appear in any channels.
              Adding a `channels` property to each document is the easiest way to map documents to channels but if you need more advanced behavior such as read and write access, you'll probably need to write your own Sync Function.

            type: object
            description: |+
              **About**

              This **replications** property is where you configure all SG-Replicate 2.0 replications associated with this database. It comprises one or more named replication definitions.

              Add a *replication definition* object for each replication to be associated with this database.

              **Options**

              Your replications can be one of two available types --

              - Persistent -- the replication survives node restarts.
              These replications can also be launched dynamically using the Rest API `_replication` endpoint (see -- [Admin Rest API](rest-api-admin.html))

              - Ad-hoc -- the replication runs once and then the replication definition is removed when the replication is stopped.
              This includes when a one-shot replication completes, or a continuous replication is stopped via the _replicationStatus endpoint.

                Transient replications are initiated using the REST API's *_replication* endpoint.
                These replications are not guaranteed to run on the initiating node and will instead be distributed across available nodes.

              **Using**

              To configure SG-Replicate 1.0 replications -- see
              [SG-Replicate 1.0 Replications](configuration-properties-legacy.html#replications).

              For more on upgrading from SG-Replicate 1.0 -- see
              [Moving to SG-Replicate 2.](upgrading.html#sg-replicate-to-inter-sync-gateway).

              **Constraints**

              - Replications are defined in the context of a local database, with the replication pulling-to or pushing-from this database. This change means that you cannot to set-up replication between two remote databases, as -- by definition -- at least one database **must** be local.

              - The following REST API only parameters are omitted from this configuration schema -- refer to [Admin Rest API](./rest-api-admin.adoc) for details:
                - `adhoc=true` for transient replications
                - `cancel=true` to cancel a replication

                  **About**

                  Use this replication definition object's name to specify this replication's `replication_id`.

                  **Behavior**

                  In use, this *replication definition* object will comprise all, or a subset, of its properties (defined below). It defines a single replication.

                  The database under which it is defined may be associated with more than one replication. You should add a replication definition  object for each replication.

                  Give each a unique name, which will serve as the `replication_id`. This is the ID by which Sync Gateway recognizes and utilizes a replication.

                  **Constraints**
                  - For new replications -- if no `replication_id` is specified, Sync Gateway will assign a random UUID

                  - For `_replicate` REST API calls only -- If the 'cancel' property is true, this *replication_id* identifies which active replication task to cancel.

                      **About**

                      Use the Admin REST API's `adhoc` parameter to specify that a replication is ad hoc rather than persistent.

                      **Behavior**

                      Ad hoc replications behave the same as normal replications, but they are automatically removed when their status changes to stopped.
                      This will usually be on completion, but may also be as a result of user action.

                      **Constraints**

                      This parameter is **NOT** available in configured replications; only those initialized using the Admin REST API.

                      Use `batch_size` to specify the number of changes to be included in a single batch during replication.

                      **Behavior**

                      Increasing this value above the default may reduce processing time, whilst also consuming more memory resource.

                      Use this parameter on,y when you want to want to cancel an existing active replication.

                      **Constraints**

                      - This parameter is **NOT** available in configured replications; only those initialized using the Admin REST API.

                      - **NOTE** that the body of the request must be the same as the replication's replication definition for the cancellation request to be honoured.

                      For example, if you requested continuous replication, the cancellation request must also contain the continuous field.

                      **About**

                      Use `conflict_resolution_type` to specify how Sync Gateway should resolve conflicts. By default the automatic conflict resolution policy is applied.

                      **Valid options**
                        - `default`
                        - `localWins`
                        - `remoteWins`
                        - `custom`

                      **For Example**
                      ```
                        "conflict_resolution_type":"custom"
                      ```

                      **Behavior**

                      The `conflict_resolution_type` defines the conflict resolution policy Sync Gateway applies to resolve conflicting revisions.

                      - `default` -- the automatic conflict resolution policy is applied, that is --
                        - Deletes always win (the delete with longest revision history wins if both revisions are deletes)
                        - The revision with the longest revision history wins (so, the one with most changes and consequently the highest revision Id).

                      - `localWins` -- Selecting `localWins` will result in local revisions always being the winner in any conflict.
                      - `remoteWins` -- Selecting `remoteWins` will result in remote revisions always being the winner in any conflict.

                      - `custom` -- Selecting `custom` specifies that you want to handle resolution with your own application logic. You **must** provide this logic as a Javascript function by specifying it using the a [custom-conflict-resolver](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications-custom-conflict-resolver).

                      **Constraints**
                      - replications created prior to version 2.8 will default to `default`.

                  continuous:
                    type: boolean
                    default: 'false'
                    description: |+
                      **About**

                      Use `continuous` to specify whether this replication will run continuously, or be one-shot.

                      **Behavior**

                      - `continuous=true`-- In continuous mode, changes are immediately synced in accordance with the replication definition.
                      - `continuous=false`-- In one-shot mode, detected changes are synced in accordance with the replication definition. The replication ceases once all revisions are processed.

                      If omitted the replication defaults to one-shot mode.

                      **Constraints**

                      - Optional for stops and removes

                  custom_conflict_resolver:

                      **About**

                      Use `custom_conflict_resolver` to provide the Javascript function used to resolve conflicts if `"conflict_resolution_type": "custom"`.


                      **Valid Options**

                      The property is *mandatory* when `"conflict_resolution_type": "custom"` and is ignored in all other cases.

                      **Behavior**

                      The optional `custom_conflict_resolver` property specifies the Javascript function that will be used to resolve conflicts. It is used only when `custom` is specified as the[conflict_resolution_type](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications-conflict_resolution_type).

                      Provide the required logic in a Javascript function, as a string within backticks (see also the description for the [sync function](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-sync)).

                      The function takes one parameter `struct` representing the conflict and comprising
                      - the document id
                      - the local document
                      - the remote document

                      The function returns a document `struct` representing the winning revision.

                      **Example**
                      ```
                      "custom_conflict_resolver":`
                        function(conflict) {
                          console.log("full remoteDoc doc: "+JSON.stringify(conflict.RemoteDocument));
                        return conflict.RemoteDocument;
                      }`
                      ```

                      **Constraints**

                      Using complex `custom_conflict_resolver` functions can noticeably degrade performance. Use a built-in resolver whenever possible.

                  direction:

                      **About**

                      Use `direction` to specify the replication is *push*, *pull* or *pushAndPull* relative to this node.

                      **Behavior**

                      The property value is referenced by the [remote](configuration-properties-legacy.html#database-this_db-replications-remote) property.

                      - `pull` -- changes are pulled from the `remote` database
                      - `push` -- changes are pushed to the `remote` database
                      - `pushAndPull` -- changes are both pushed-to and pulled-from the `remote` database

                      **Constraints**

                      Replications created prior to version 2.8 derive their *direction* from the [source](configuration-properties-legacy.html#replications-source) and [target](configuration-properties-legacy.html#replications-target) url of the replication.

                  enable_delta_sync:

                    description: |+
                      **About**

                      Use `enable_delta_sync` to specify use of delta sync for this replication.

                      It works in conjunction with [database.this_db.delta_sync.enabled](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-delta_sync-enabled), which specifies whether the database can use delta sync or not.

                      **Options**

                      To use delta sync or not.

                      - `"enable_delta_sync": true`, the replication can use delta sync (depending on `delta_sync.enabled` setting
                      - `"enable_delta_sync": false` -- the replication cannot use delta sync

                      **Behavior**

                      The optional `enable_delta_sync` property works in conjunction with the database level [database.this_db.delta_sync.enabled](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-delta_sync-enabled) setting, to determine whether this replication uses delta sync.

                      - **If** `"delta_sync.enabled": true` for both databases involved in the replication, then this parameter enables or disables its use for this specific replication.

                      -  In all other cases it has no effect and the replication runs without delta-sync.

                      **Constraints**

                      - Requires *Enterprise Edition*
                      - Depends upon setting of [database.this_db.delta_sync.enabled](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-delta_sync)
                      - Replications created prior to version 2.8 must run with `"enable_delta_sync": false`
                      - Push replications will not use Delta Sync when pushing to a pre-2.8 target
                  filter:

                      **About**

                      Use `filter` to specify the name of the function to be used to filter documents.

                      **Options**

                      A common value used when replicating from Sync Gateway is `sync_gateway/bychannel`. This option limits the pull replication to a specific set of channels. You can specify the required channels using [query_params](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications-query_params).

                      **Behavior**

                      Works in conjunction with.[query_params](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications-query_params) to control the documents processed by the replication.

                      **Example**

                      ```
                      "filter":"sync_gateway/bychannel"
                      ```

                      **Constraints**

                      OPTIONAL for stops and removes (even if defined during creation)

                    type: integer
                    default: 5 - five minutes
                    description: |+
                      **About**

                      Use `max_backoff_time` to specify the number of minutes Sync Gateway will spend trying to reconnect lost or unreachable `remote` targets.

                      **Behavior**

                      On disconnection Sync Gateway performs an exponential backoff up to `max_backoff_time` minutes. Thereafter, it will try to reconnect indefinitely every `max_backoff_time` minutes.

                      If a zero value is specified, Sync Gateway does an exponential backoff for up to five minutes before stopping the replication.

                      **Constraints**

                      The value defaults to five minutes for replications created prior to version 2.8.

                      **About**

                        Use `password` to provide the login password value for the accredited user running this replication.

                      **Behavior**

                        These details are used to authenticate credentials and approve access to data.

                        Once provided and recorded, the password data is redacted and will not be displayed in either the configuration file or Admin REST API. A string of `****` will be displayed in its place.

                      **About**

                      Use `purge_on_removal` to specify (per replication) whether removing a `channel` should trigger a purge.

                      **Options**
                      - `true` or `false`
                      - Default = false -- document removals are ignored

                      **Behavior**

                      If `purge_on_removal=false`, then the removal of channels is ignored (not purged) by the receiving end.

                      **Constraints**

                      Replications created prior to version 2.8 *must* be run with `purge_on_removal=false`.

                  query_params:

                    description: |+
                      **About**

                      Use `query_params` to specify the key/value pairs to be passed to the filter named in `filter`.

                      **Behavior**

                      This property works in conjunction with [filters](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications-filter) and [channels](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications-channels) to provide routing.

                      **Using**

                      You can use `query_params`' *channels* function to allow only a specific set of `channels` to pass.
                      To do so, you would also need to set the `filter` to  `sync_gateway/bychannels`.

                      For example :

                      ```json
                        "filter":"sync_gateway/bychannel",
                        "query_params": {
                          "channels":["thisChannel"]
                        },
                      ```

                      **Constraints**

                      OPTIONAL for stops and removes (even if defined during creation)
                    items:
                      type: string

                    type: string
                    default: mandatory
                    description: |+
                      **About**

                      Use `remote` to specify the database endpoint on the remote Sync Gateway custer.

                      **Options**

                      The format can be one of --
                      - a string containing a valid URL for a (remote) Sync Gateway database.
                      - an object whose url property contains the Sync Gateway database URL.

                      **Behavior**

                      The `remote` property represents a database endpoint for the remote Sync Gateway cluster.
                      That is, it identifies the remote cluster that is the subject of this replication's *push*, *pull* or *pushAndPull action*.

                      The effect of this setting is dependent upon the setting of the [direction](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications-direction) configuration property.

                      If direction is :
                      - `direction=pull`, then `remote` defines the remote cluster *from* which data is pulled
                      - `direction=push`, then `remote` defines the remote cluster *to* which data is pushed
                      - `direction=pushAndPull`, then `remote` defines the remote cluster *to* which data is pushed.

                      **Example**

                      ```
                       "remote": "http://www.example.com:4984/db2name",
                      ```

                      **Constraints**

                      - You must specify the 'remote' database's url even if it is located on the same cluster as the replication's database.
                      - OPTIONAL for stops and removes

                  replication_id:
                    type: string
                    description: |+
                      **About**

                      Use `replication_id` to specify an identifying name for the replication.

                      **Behavior**

                      The *replication_id* property specifies either:
                      - For NEW replications, the ID to be assigned to the the replication. If no *replication_id* is specified, Sync Gateway will assign a random UUID to new replications.
                      - For existing replications, this is the ID of the required replication.
                      - If **cancel=true**, this is the id of the active replication task to be cancelled.

                      **Constraints**

                      - If specified in configuration, it must match the name of the replication definition object.
                      - If specified in the body of an Admin REST API request, it must match the `replication_id` specified in the request URL.

                  initial_state:

                    description: |+
                      **About**

                        Use `initial_state` to specify the initial state of the replication on launch.

                      **Behavior**

                      All replications are configured to auto-start on Sync Gateway launch. So, if omitted, the `initial_state` defaults to ```running```.

                      To prevent the auto-start behavior, include `initial_state` with a value of `stopped` (```"initial_state" "stopped"```)

                      **Constraints**

                      Replications created prior to version 2.8 will all default to a initial_state of ```running```.

                      **About**

                        Use `username` to provide the name of the accredited user running this replication.

                        **Behavior**

                        These details are used to authenticate credentials and approve access to data

                        Once provided and recorded, the username data is redacted and will not be displayed in either the configuration file or Admin REST API. A string of `****` will be displayed in its place.

                        Replications initiated by this user will pull all documents in all channels the user has access grants for.
                        If the all channels wildcard was used to grant access then the sync will pull *ALL* documents.
                        Use a filter to avoid syncing excessive amounts of data to mobile devices.

      - Access: Anytime an access() call is made in the sync function.
      - Attach: Attachment processing.
      - Auth: Authentication.
      - Bucket: Sync Gateway interactions with the bucket (verbose logging).

      - CRUD: Updates made by Sync Gateway to documents.
      - DCP: DCP-feed processing (verbose logging).
      - Events: Event processing (webhooks).
      - Feed: Server-feed processing.
      - HTTP: All requests made to the Sync Gateway REST APIs (Sync and Admin). Note that the log keyword HTTP is always enabled, which means that HTTP requests and error responses are always logged (in a non-verbose manner). HTTP+ provides more verbose HTTP logging.
      - Replicate: Log messages related to replications between Sync Gateways (using sg-replicate). This tag cannot be used for replications initiated by Couchbase Lite.
      - Import+: This logging key was introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5 to help troubleshoot the import process of a document (this is the Sync Gateway process to make a document that was added through N1QL or the Server SDKs mobile-aware). This log key can be useful to troubleshoot why a given document was not successfully imported.

      **Support Notice**
      (**Deprecated**) This SG-Replicate 1.0 method of configuring replication is deprecated at version 2.8. For replication using the SG-Replicate 2.0 protocol configure the replication properties under _database.replications_ instead -- see [SG-Replicate 2.0 Replications](configuration-properties-legacy.html#databases-this_db-replications).

      **NOTE:** Sync Gateway will fail to start if any replications defined at this level do involve at least one local database (source and-or target); an error is recorder in the log.

      **About**
      SG-Replicate 1.0 replications :

      - default to a 'Running' state
      - do not support built-in, or custom, conflict resolution -- see [SG-Replicate 2.0 Conflict Resolution](sync-inter-syncgateway-conflict-resolution.html)
      - use `source` and `target` to derive replication direction
